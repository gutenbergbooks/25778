<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>POLLY RETURNS TO AMERICA</h3>
</div>

<p>Five girls were promenading the deck of one
of our great Atlantic liners, on the last day of the
trip. The report had gone out that they might
expect to reach quarantine before five o&#8217;clock, but
it would be too late to dock that night, therefore
the captain had planned an evening&#8217;s entertainment
for all on board.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Brewster! Miss Polly Brewster!
Polly Brewster!&#8221; came a call from one of the
young boys of the crew who was acting as messenger
for the wireless operator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, he is calling you! I wonder what it
is?&#8221; cried Eleanor Maynard, Polly&#8217;s dearest
friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, boy! I am Polly Brewster,&#8221; called
Polly, waving her hand to call his attention to
herself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Polly Brewster?&#8221; asked the uniformed
attendant politely, lifting his cap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He handed her an envelope such as the wireless
messages are delivered in, and bowed to take his
leave of the group of girls. Polly gazed at the
outside of the envelope but did not open it. Her
friends laughed and Nancy Fabian, the oldest girl
of the five, said teasingly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it delicious to worry one&#8217;s self over who
could have sent us a welcome, when we <i>might</i>
know for certain, if we would but act prosaically
and open the seal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls laughed, and Eleanor remarked,
knowingly: &#8220;Oh, <i>Polly</i> knows who it is from!
She just wants to enjoy a few extra thrills before
she reads the message.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla, I do <i>not</i> know, and you know it!
You always make &#8216;a mountain from a mole-hill.&#8217;
I declare, you are actually growing to be childish
in your old age!&#8221; retorted Polly, sarcastically.
</p>
<p>Her latter remark drew forth a peal of laughter
from the girls, Eleanor included. But Polly
failed to join in the laugh. She cast a withering
glance at Eleanor, and walked aside to open
the envelope. The four interested girls watched
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
her eagerly as she read the short message.
</p>
<p>Polly would have given half of her mine on
Grizzly Slide, to have controlled her expression.
But the very knowledge that the four friends were
critically eyeing her, made her flush uncomfortably
as she folded up the paper again, and slipped
it in her pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! What did I tell you! It is from
HIM!&#8221; declared Eleanor, laughingly.
</p>
<p>Dorothy Alexander was duly impressed, for she
had firmly believed, hitherto, that Polly was a
man-hater. The manner in which she had
scorned Jimmy Osgood on that tour of England
would have led anyone to believe that such was the
case. Now the tell-tale blush and Eleanor&#8217;s
innuendo, caused Dorothy to reconsider her
earlier judgment.
</p>
<p>Polly curled her full red lip at Eleanor&#8217;s remark,
and was about to speak of something of
general interest, when Dorothy unexpectedly
asked a (to her) pertinent question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, has anyone ever proposed to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed softly to herself, and Polly
sent poor Dodo a pitying glance. &#8220;Is that little
head of yours entirely void of memory, Dodo?&#8221;
said she.
</p>
<p>Then, without waiting for a reply, Polly continued:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
&#8220;Did not Jimmy propose to me, as well
as to every one of you girls?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but I didn&#8217;t mean that sort of an affair,&#8221;
explained Dorothy. &#8220;I mean&mdash;were you ever in
love with anyone who thought he loved <i>you</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t this a delightful conversation? I
wouldn&#8217;t have missed it for anything in the
world!&#8221; laughed Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla,&#8221; rebuked Polly, seriously, &#8220;your head
has been so turned since all those poor fortune-hunters
in Europe flattered you, that I fear you
will never succeed in business with me. I shall
have to find someone else who will prove trustworthy
and work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s threat did not appear to disturb Eleanor
very much, for she laughed merrily and retorted:
&#8220;Dodo, if I answer your question for Polly, what
will you do for me, some day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla, you mind your own affairs!&#8221; exclaimed
Polly, flushing again. &#8220;Dodo is such a tactless
child that she never stops to consider whether her
questions are too personal, or not. But <i>you</i>&mdash;well,
you know better, and I forbid you to discuss
me any further.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, girls! This little joke is really
going too far, if Polly feels hurt about it. Let
us drop the subject and talk about the dance the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
Captain is going to give us tonight,&#8221; suggested
Nancy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to wear the new gown mother got
in Paris,&#8221; announced Dorothy. &#8220;Ma says we can
save duty on it if I wear it before it reaches
shore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other girls laughed, and Eleanor added:
&#8220;That&#8217;s a good plan, Dodo. I guess I will follow
your example. I&#8217;ve got so many dutiable things
in my trunks, that I really ought to economise on
something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t wear one of my new dresses tonight
for just that reason. If I want them badly
enough, to bring them all the way from Paris
where we get them so much cheaper than on this
side, then I&#8217;m willing to pay Uncle Sam his revenue
on them,&#8221; said Polly, loftily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho! I don&#8217;t believe it is duty you are saving,
as much as indulging in perverseness by not
donning one of your most fetching gowns,&#8221; declared
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it is,&#8221; said Polly, smiling tantalizingly
at her chum. &#8220;Perhaps I want to keep the freshness
of them for someone in New York, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! <i>He</i> will be there to meet you,
sure thing!&#8221; laughed Eleanor.
</p>
<p>At that, Dorothy drew Eleanor aside and, when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Polly was not looking, whispered eagerly: &#8220;Do
tell me who he is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Eleanor laughingly shook her head and
whispered back: &#8220;I dare not! That is Polly&#8217;s
secret!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But she did not add for Dorothy&#8217;s edification,
that try as she would, she (Eleanor) had never
been able to make Polly confess whether she preferred
one swain to another. As Eleanor considered
this a weakness in her own powers of persuasion,
she never allowed anyone to question her
that far.
</p>
<p>Had anyone of the four girls dreamed of who
the sender of the wireless was, what a buzzing
there would have been! Eleanor Maynard would
have been so pleased at the possibility of a romance,
that she would have acted even more tantalizing,
in Polly&#8217;s opinion, than she had been of
late months.
</p>
<p>Perhaps you are not as well acquainted with
Polly and her friends, however, as I am, and it
would be unkind to continue their experiences for
your entertainment, until after you are duly informed
of how Polly happened to leave her home
in Oak Creek and also what had passed during
the Summer in Europe.
</p>
<p>Polly Brewster was born and reared on a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Rocky Mountain ranch, in Colorado, and had until
her fourteenth year, never been farther from
her home than Oak Creek, which was the railroad
station and post office of the many ranchers of
that section.
</p>
<p>Eleanor Maynard, the younger daughter of
Mr. Maynard who was a prosperous banker of
Chicago, accompanied her sister Barbara and
Anne Stewart, the teacher, when they spent a summer
on the ranch. Their thrilling adventures during
the first half of that summer are told in the
book called &#8220;Polly of Pebbly Pit,&#8221; the first volume
of this series.
</p>
<p>After the discovery of the gold mine on Grizzly
Slide, and the subsequent troubles with the claim-jumpers,
Polly and her friends sent for John
Brewster who was engaged to Anne Stewart, and
Tom Latimer, John&#8217;s best friend, to leave their
engineering work on some mines, for the time being,
and hasten to Pebbly Pit to advise about the
gold mine, and to take action to protect the girls.
These experiences are told in the second volume
of this series.
</p>
<p>Success being assured in the mining plans of the
gold vein on Grizzly Slide, and the valuable lava
cliffs located on Pebbly Pit ranch also finding a
market as brilliant gems for use in jewelry, Polly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
and Eleanor decided to accompany Anne Stewart
to New York, where she was going to teach in an
exclusive school for young ladies.
</p>
<p>In the third book, Polly and Eleanor&#8217;s adventures
in New York are told. Their school experiences;
the amateur theatricals at which Polly
saved a girl from the fire, and thus found some
splendid friends; and the new acquaintance, Ruth
Ashby, who was the only child of the Ashbys.
They also met Mr. Fabian in a most unusual
manner, and through him, they became interested
in Interior Decorating, to study it as a profession.
When the school-year ended, all these
friends invited the two girls to join their party
that was planned to tour Europe and visit noted
places where antiques are exhibited.
</p>
<p>The following fourth book describes the amusing
incidents of the three girls on board the
steamer, after they meet the Alexanders. Mrs.
Alexander, the gorgeously-plumed ranch-woman;
Dorothy, always known as &#8220;Dodo,&#8221; the restive
girl of Polly&#8217;s own age; and little Ebeneezer Alexander,
too meek and self-effacing to deny his
spouse anything, but always providing the funds
for her caprices. This present caprice, of rushing
to Europe to find a &#8220;title&#8221; for Dodo to marry,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
was the latest and hardest of all for him to agree
to.
</p>
<p>Because of Mrs. Alexander&#8217;s whim, the
ludicrous experiences that came upon the innocent
heads of Polly and her friends, in the tour of
England in two motor cars, decided them to escape
from that lady, and run away to Paris. Before
they could sigh in relief at their freedom,
however, the Alexanders loomed again on their
horizon.
</p>
<p>Plan as they would, the badgered tourists found
that Mrs. Alexander had annexed herself permanently
to them. They resigned themselves to
the inevitable. But that carried with it more
ridiculous affairs, when Mrs. Alexander plotted
for the titles found dangling before her, in various
places on the Continent.
</p>
<p>One good result came from this association
with the Alexanders: Dodo found how fascinating
the work of collecting really was, and decided
to study decorating as an art. Hence she
spurned her mother&#8217;s ambitions for her, and announced
her plan of remaining in New York with
the girls, upon their return to America, to follow
in their line of study.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Alexander felt quite satisfied to live in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
New York for a season, as she fancied it an easy
matter to forge a way into good society there.
But her spouse detested large cities and longed
for his mining life once more, but agreed to it
because Dodo was delighted with the opportunity
opened before her, in the profession of decorator.
</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s party on board the steamer consisted
of Mr. and Mrs. Ashby and Ruth; Mr. and
Mrs. Fabian and Nancy; Mr. and Mrs. Alexander
and Dodo; and lastly, Polly Brewster and
Eleanor Maynard.
</p>
<p>Just a word about the last two girls: Polly
knew that Eleanor was fond of Paul Stewart since
she met him a few years before. And Eleanor
wondered if Polly preferred Tom Latimer to any
other young man she knew; but Polly always declared
that she was married to her profession and
had no time to spare for beaus. Hence Tom
Latimer sighed and hoped that she might change
her mind some day.
</p>
<p>Meantime, Tom lost no good opportunity to
show how he appreciated Polly and, whenever
possible, he managed to perform the little deeds
that mean so much to a woman&mdash;especially if that
woman is young and impressionable. Thus he
actually made better headway in his silent campaign
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
for Polly, by never broaching the subject of
love&mdash;from which she would have fled instantly
and then barred the doors of her heart.
</p>
<p>The wireless received by Polly was from Tom
who had been anxiously awaiting the time when
he could communicate with the vessel. The contents
of the message could have been read to all
the world without exciting comment&mdash;it was so
brotherly. But Polly felt that it was a private
welcome to her and so it was not to be shared
with others.
</p>
<p>The wireless said that Tom and Polly&#8217;s dear
friends who were in New York, had been invited
on board Mr. Dalken&#8217;s yacht, to visit the quarantined
steamer that evening. That they would arrive
about eight o&#8217;clock, having secured passes
from the Inspector at Quarantine.
</p>
<p>Although this explanation about Polly and her
associates took time for <i>us</i>, it did not interrupt
the lively banter between the five girls. Dorothy
was now certain that Polly had a real beau, somewhere,
and being so very candid and talkative herself,
she admired the reticence displayed by Polly
in keeping the affairs of her heart to herself.
</p>
<p>Dodo whispered back to Eleanor: &#8220;Dear me!
I hope he is worthy of her. She ought to have
the finest husband in the world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>Eleanor laughed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Dodo. She
will. If he was not meant for Polly, I&#8217;d try and
get him for myself&mdash;that is how much I admire
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my! Won&#8217;t you tell me something about
him, Nolla?&#8221; asked Dorothy, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t dare, Dodo,&#8221; returned Eleanor,
assuming a wise expression. &#8220;Polly would drop
me forever, if she thought I confided in anyone
about her love-affairs. Besides, you can find out
everything for yourself, now that you are going
to remain with us, this winter. Still, I would love
to know just who that wireless came from.&#8221;
Eleanor added the latter remark after a moment&#8217;s
deep consideration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what we can do,&#8221; ventured
Dorothy, in a whisper. &#8220;We have often visited
the wireless room; let&#8217;s you and I go there again,
and start a friendly chat with the operator.
Maybe he will speak of the message.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without stopping to think whether this method
would be principled or not, Eleanor eagerly
agreed to Dorothy&#8217;s plan. While Polly and
Nancy were discussing the beautiful hazy picture
made by New York&#8217;s sky-line as seen from the
Harbor at Quarantine, Dorothy and Eleanor
hurried to the wireless room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>The young man had often been entertained by
the girls during the trip from Europe, so this
visit was not suspected of having a secret motive
back of it. He chatted pleasantly with his callers
and, after a time, spoke of the very topic they
wished to hear about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you girls will all be on the <i>qui vive</i>
this evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is awfully nice of the captain, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said Eleanor, referring to the dance and thinking
that the operator also meant that event.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do not think the captain had as much
to do with the invitation as had the Inspector
General of the Quarantine. Of course we have
a clean bill for the ship or no one would have been
allowed to step on board tonight; but at the same
time your friends must have had a good hard time
to get the invitation from the authorities. Only
a New Yorker who understands the ropes, could
have managed the matter so quickly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy was about to ask what he was talking
about, when Eleanor pinched her arm for silence.
Then the latter spoke: &#8220;Oh yes! He is a wonder&mdash;we
think!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy gasped at Eleanor, and the smiling
girl winked secretly at her. The operator had
not seen the pinch nor the wink, but he continued
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
guilelessly: &#8220;Well, from what I&#8217;ve seen of Miss
Polly, only a &#8216;wonder&#8217; would cause her to notice
him at all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed at his own words and Eleanor
joined him, even though she failed to see a joke.
Then she said: &#8220;Polly could have so <i>many</i> admirers,
but she never looks at a man. Perhaps
that is why all you males sigh so broken-heartedly
at her heels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man laughed softly to himself.
&#8220;Maybe! But this &#8216;Tom&#8217; seems to feel assured
of a &#8216;look&#8217; from her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now it was Dorothy&#8217;s turn to pinch Eleanor,
and she did so with great gusto. Eleanor winced
but dared not express herself in any other manner,
just then. She was too keen on the trail of
learning what she could, to signify any sense of
having felt that pinch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;Tom! He is an old family friend, you
know. He was Polly&#8217;s brother&#8217;s college-chum
for four years while both boys studied at the University
of Chicago. I am from Chicago, and I
knew those boys when they used to come to my
home with my brother, who also attended the
engineering classes. There was a fourth boy&mdash;Paul
Stewart, who was from Denver. Anne
Stewart was his sister and she married John
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
Brewster, this Spring. So you see, we are all old
friends together. I suppose the whole family
crowd will come out on the yacht, tonight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy listened in sheer amazement, as
Eleanor spoke with all the assurance possible.
But Dorothy was not aware of Eleanor&#8217;s lifelong
training in the home of a social leader of
Chicago&#8217;s exclusive set. That such a home-training
made a girl precocious and subtle, was
not strange, and Eleanor had had fourteen years
of such a life before she went to Pebbly Pit and
met Polly. Habits so well-engrounded are not
easily broken, or forgotten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the sender ought to have sent his message
to one of the adults of the party. Even <i>I</i>
misjudged the matter, because I thought this
&#8216;Tom&#8217; must be a faithful admirer of Miss Polly&#8217;s
to get through to visit the steamer tonight,&#8221; explained
the operator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he isn&#8217;t coming alone&mdash;didn&#8217;t you stop
to consider that?&#8221; asked Eleanor, eagerly. &#8220;Seeing
that most of the friends are Polly&#8217;s personal
ones, the wire was sent to her, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that hurt me, was that no one
sent me a message. Tom is as dear to me as to
Polly, and I wonder he did not wire me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps this Tom thought you would have
scores of eager messages the moment your beaus
knew you were near enough to get them,&#8221; laughed
the young officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they didn&#8217;t! But I want you to do
something for me&mdash;will you?&#8221; asked Eleanor,
quite unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will if I can,&#8221; agreed the officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Write off a fake message for me and sign
some make-believe name to it, so I can hold my
head up with Polly. She will never let me rest
if she thinks she got a line, and I didn&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is easy to do. As long as we know
it will never come out, and that I wrote a line to
you, it will be a good joke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; laughed Eleanor, delightedly.
&#8220;Now write:&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She stopped suddenly, then
thought for a moment before she said: &#8220;Why
not copy the exact words sent to Polly, but sign
another name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll write one, as much like the original as
possible without actually duplicating that information,&#8221;
chuckled the officer.
</p>
<p>Then he took up a slip of paper and wrote:
&#8220;Miss Eleanor Maynard. We will join you this
evening, on steamer. Yacht will arrive about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
eight.&#8221; He looked up laughingly and asked:
&#8220;Now what name shall we sign to this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;let me see! Sign &#8216;Paul.&#8217; I know he is
in New York, now, so I am not taking chances of
making a mistake,&#8221; laughed Eleanor.
</p>
<p>The name &#8220;Paul&#8221; was added to the message
and the paper placed in an envelope. This was
addressed to Eleanor Maynard and her stateroom
number written down upon it. Then it was
handed to the gratified girl.
</p>
<p>The young man was thanked with unwarranted
warmth, and the two girls hastened away.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A DISAPPOINTING EVENING</h3>
</div>

<p>Eleanor and Dorothy did not join their
friends at once, after leaving the wireless room.
Eleanor explained wisely: &#8220;We must promenade
along the deck and let them see us reading and
talking over the message, you know, to make them
believe we just got it from the boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So this little act was carried out, and when
the two girls felt sure that Polly and her companions
had noticed them reading the wireless
message, Eleanor whispered: &#8220;Now we can
stroll over and join them. Leave it to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just before she joined her friends, Eleanor
thrust the paper into her sweater pocket, and
seemed not to remember it. But Nancy spoke
of it, immediately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you received a <i>billet-doux</i>, too. Is there
any reason why I should not say to you exactly
what you said to Polly, when she got hers?&#8221;
laughed the young lady.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not at all! I am not so bashful about
my affair,&#8221; retorted Eleanor, taking the paper
from her pocket and handing it to Nancy. &#8220;You
may read it aloud, if you choose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Nancy read, and the fact that the words
conveyed the same information as Polly&#8217;s had
done, but the sender had signed himself &#8220;Paul,&#8221;
made Polly feel relieved. Then she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is evident that someone secured a yacht to
carry our friends out to see us this evening. My
message said about the same thing, so now, you
see, it was ridiculous in Eleanor to tease about it
being a love-note. Had she been sensible I would
have read it aloud to all, but because of her silliness,
I made up my mind to keep her guessing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nancy and Ruth laughed, but Eleanor and
Dorothy exchanged glances with each other.
Then Nancy said anxiously: &#8220;We ought to start
and dress most fetchingly for tonight, if everyone
you know is coming out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before anyone could reply to this suggestion,
Mr. Fabian was seen hurrying across the deck
to join them. &#8220;Girls, our old friend Dalken has
a yacht, I hear, and he has invited everyone we
know to come out here this evening to welcome
us home. We are to be ready to return with him,
as he has secured the necessary bill-of-health for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
us. Now get down to your rooms quickly and
pack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;aren&#8217;t we going to remain to the dance?&#8221;
asked Eleanor, with disappointment in her tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do as you please about that, but we
will go back on the yacht when she returns to
the city.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the bustle of packing the stateroom trunks,
and then dressing for the evening, the girls forgot
about the wireless messages. Then during
the dinner that was like a party affair because of
the passengers&#8217; exuberant spirits at being so near
home again, Mr. Fabian smiled approvingly at
the five young girls in his charge. They looked
so charming in their Paris gowns, and their youthful
forms and faces expressed such joy and pleasure
in living, that he felt gratified to think the
old friends would see them as <i>he</i> did that evening.
</p>
<p>Shortly after leaving the dining-salon, the attention
of the Fabian party was drawn to a graceful
white yacht that sailed swiftly down the Bay
and soon came alongside the steamer. The spotless
looking sailors instantly lowered the boat and
a party of young people got in. The Fabian
group leaned over the rail of the steamer and
watched breathlessly as the boat was rowed across
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
the intervening space and, finally, was made fast
to the steamer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poll, did you recognize your future Fate?&#8221;
giggled Eleanor, nudging her companion,
knowingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw <i>yours</i>!&#8221; retorted Polly. &#8220;And now I
comprehend why you can speak of nothing else
than beaus and Fate! You are so obsessed by
your own dreams that you think everyone you
know must be dreaming the same stuff!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly turned quickly and hurried to the spot
where the visitors were being greeted by Mr. Fabian,
and the other girls, laughing at the repartee,
followed. In the first group to arrive were Tom
Latimer and his younger brother Jim; Kenneth
Evans, Jim&#8217;s chum; Paul Stewart; and John
Brewster with Anne, his bride.
</p>
<p>Happy welcomes were exchanged between
everyone, but Polly purposely avoided any extra
favor being shown Tom Latimer, although he
looked as if he deserved it more than Jim and his
friend Kenneth. Eleanor quite openly showed
her preference for Paul, when they separated
from the others for the evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Mr. Dalken and the others?&#8221; asked
Polly, gazing around at the small group that had
arrived on board.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The boat is going back for the second installment,&#8221;
explained Anne, keeping an arm about
Polly&#8217;s waist. &#8220;We-all were too impatient to see
you to accept the suggestion of waiting for the
second trip, so the older ones sent us off first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To Polly&#8217;s surprise and joy, the second boat-load
brought her father and mother, Mrs.
Stewart, the Latimers, the Evans, and Mr.
Dalken, the owner of the yacht. When the family
circle was complete, on board the steamer,
they proved to be a happy party, and many of
the passengers wished they were included in that
merry group.
</p>
<p>The steamer rolled gently with the swells from
the ocean, while the full moon shone mistily
through a fog that veiled its brightness enough to
add romance to the meeting of the various young
people on deck. Eleanor and Paul had been genuinely
delighted to see each other again, and
neither cared <i>who</i> knew just how much they liked
each other.
</p>
<p>Polly watched them for a time, then smiled as
they walked away to discover a cozy retreat behind
one of the giant smoke-stacks, where they
could enjoy a tête-à-tête without interruption.
When she turned to hear what her brother John
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
was saying, she found Tom Latimer just at her
elbow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we find a nice sheltered spot where
you can tell me all about your trip abroad?&#8221; suggested
Tom, his eyes speaking too plainly how
anxious he was to get Polly away from the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d far rather be with the crowd and hear
all that is being said,&#8221; said Polly, nervously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said Tom, moodily. &#8220;I only
thought you&#8217;d like to hear all about Grizzly Slide
and how it&#8217;s been cutting up this summer. The
gold mine has had several adventurers trying to
jump the claim, too; and Rainbow Cliffs has had
an injunction served on it so that we are tied up
by law, this year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So mother wrote to me. But I don&#8217;t want to
hear about troubles and business tonight. I just
want to enjoy myself after coming home to all the
dear folks,&#8221; said Polly.
</p>
<p>Tom was too unsophisticated with girls, although
he was so popular with men, to make allowance
for the contrary spirit that often sways
a girl when she wishes to make a good impression;
so he sulked and followed at Polly&#8217;s heels
when she hurried after her friends.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken turned just now, and saw the girl
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
running as if to get away from Tom, and he understood,
fairly well, just how matters were. So
he endeavored to calm Polly&#8217;s perturbed spirit
and encourage Tom&#8217;s &#8220;faint heart&#8221; at the same
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Polly dear,&#8221; said he, placing an arm
about her shoulders, &#8220;now that you have seen
many of the wonder-spots of Europe, and know
more about antiques and art than any of us, I
suppose you are quite decided that business is not
your forte, eh? The next thing I&#8217;ll hear from
you, you&#8217;ll have dropped your ambitions and
be sailing down a love-stream to a snug harbor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed not! You ought to know me better
than that, Mr. Dalken,&#8221; declared Polly, vehemently,
causing her companions to laugh. &#8220;I
am more determined than ever, since seeing such
wonderful things in Europe, to devote my life
to my chosen profession. Why, the marvellous
objects I saw in Europe, used in interior decorating
in centuries past, enthuse me anew. I wonder
that anyone can keep from studying this fascinating
art where there is such a broad field of work
and interest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s mother and father listened to their
daughter, with adoration plainly expressed on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
their faces, and Tom had to grit his teeth to keep
from swearing, because of what he considered
their influence over Polly in this, her foolish infatuation
for a business when she ought to be in
love with him.
</p>
<p>When Mr. Dalken saw that he had launched a
dangerous subject for Polly and Tom, he had a
bright idea. So he acted upon it instantly. He
excused himself from his friends&#8217; circle, and
sought the Captain. In a short time thereafter,
the passengers heard the band playing dance
music, and immediately, most of the younger set
hurried to the Grand Salon.
</p>
<p>It was second nature with Polly to dance, and
she did so with as much grace as she rode her
father&#8217;s thoroughbred horses on the ranch; or
hiked the Rockies, over boulders and down-timber
like a fawn. Kenneth Evans, the youngest
man in the party from the city, was by far the
handsomest one in the group; and when he guided
Polly through the maze of dancers, they both attracted
much attention.
</p>
<p>Tom stood and sulked while he watched Polly
dance, but he refused to dance himself, although
he was considered a most desirable partner by
any one who had ever danced with him. Eleanor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
was having such a thoroughly good time while
dancing with Paul, that she forgot about the romances
and lovers&#8217; quarrels of others.
</p>
<p>The moment Kenneth escorted Polly to a chair
and stood fanning her, Tom pushed a way over
to them and said, quite assuredly: &#8220;The next
dance is mine, Polly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I never told you so, at all!&#8221; exclaimed
Polly, annoyed at Tom&#8217;s tone and manner.
&#8220;How do you know there will be another one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom flushed and sent Kenneth an angry glance,
although poor Ken was innocent of any guile in
this case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do not care to dance with me, Polly,
say so, and I&#8217;ll go to the smoking-room and enjoy
the companionship of men who appreciate me,&#8221;
retorted Tom, impatiently.
</p>
<p>The imp of resistance took instant possession
of Polly, and she said: &#8220;Tom, there&#8217;s where you
belong&mdash;with men who want to talk about work
and money. You are too old to enjoy youthful
follies as I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom had been dreaming of this meeting with
Polly again, for so long, that now everything
seemed shattered for him. He felt so injured
at her mention of his age in comparison with her
own, that he said nothing more, but turned on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
his heel and marched away without a backward
glance. His very foot-falls spoke of his feelings.
</p>
<p>Polly turned to Kenneth and resumed her
laughing banter, and he thought she was glad to
rid herself of Tom&#8217;s company. He felt puzzled,
too, because Tom Latimer, in <i>his</i> estimation, was
everything noble and manly. But Kenneth was
inexperienced with girls&#8217; subtleties. Had Eleanor
been present she would have understood perfectly
how matters were.
</p>
<p>After this incident, Polly danced every dance
with a gayety of manner that she did not truly
feel. Some of the joy of that party was lacking,
but she would not question the cause of it.
</p>
<p>Tom went directly to the smoking-room where
he sat down to brood over his misery. He never
filled his pipe, but sat lost in thought until a
friendly voice at his elbow said: &#8220;Well, old
pard! Anne says you are to come with me. She
has a word to say. She is a wizard, too, so you&#8217;d
best obey without question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom looked up and saw John. &#8220;Can Anne
help me in the planning of the legal defence of
those lava-cliffs at Pebbly Pit?&#8221; Tom demanded
of his friend.
</p>
<p>John smiled knowingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit you&#8217;re not
smoking, even though you rushed to a sanctum
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
protected from girls&#8217; invasion; and you are not
thinking of lava or injunctions, just now. You&#8217;re
pitying yourself for what you consider shabby
treatment, while all the time Anne can see that
your evening&#8217;s disappointment is your own
fault.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom weakened. &#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, tell
Anne to advise me what to do, if she knows every
cure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on and have a talk with her. She is just
outside, waiting for us,&#8221; coaxed John, placing his
arm in that of his friend&#8217;s, and gently forcing him
out of the room.
</p>
<p>When Tom met Anne&#8217;s sympathetic eyes, he
confessed. &#8220;Anne, what&#8217;s the matter with Polly?
She doesn&#8217;t seem to know I am on earth. Did
you watch her enjoy that dance with a kid like
Ken, and then snub <i>me</i> outright when I asked her
to dance the next one with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what she did, Tom, but let me
give you a bit of sensible advice about Polly.
John thinks I am right in this, too, don&#8217;t you,
dear?&#8221; Wise Anne Brewster turned anxiously to
John for his opinion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Tom, Anne is a wonder in such things.
You listen to her, old man,&#8221; agreed John.
</p>
<p>Tom sighed heavily and signified his willingness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
to listen to anything that would end his heartache.
Both his companions smiled as if they
deemed this case an everyday matter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, you are morbid from over-work at the
mines,&#8221; began Anne. &#8220;Remember this, Polly has
been on the go in Europe all summer, seeing first
one interesting thing after another, and not giving
a single thought to you, or anyone, on this side
the water. She sneered at anyone who tried to
flatter her, or pretended to make love to her,
while in Europe, and only cared for art during
that tour which meant so much to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be thankful that she took this
attitude, and returned home heart-whole. What
would you have done, had she fallen in love with
an attractive young man with a title? But she
was too sensible for that. She returns home with
her mind still filled with the wonderful things she
saw abroad, and eager to tell everyone she knows
all about her trip. Naturally, she never gives a
thought to a lover, or a future husband. She is
too young for that sort of thing, anyway, and her
family would discourage anyone who suggested
such ideas to her. We want her to continue her
studies and find joy and satisfaction in her work,
until she is twenty-one, at least, and then she can
consider matrimony.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Tom, that we all favor you immensely,
as a future husband for Polly, but we
certainly would discountenance any advances you
might make right now, to turn Polly&#8217;s thoughts
from sensible work and endeavor, to a state of
discontent caused by the dreams of young love.
If you are not willing to be a good friend to the
girl, now, and wait until she is older, before you
show your intentions, then I will certainly do my
utmost to keep Polly out of your way. But if,
on the other hand, you promise to guard your
expression and behavior, and only treat Polly as
a good brother might, then we will do everything
in our power to protect Polly from any other admirers
and to further your interests as best we
can. Do you understand, now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom had listened thoughtfully, and when Anne
concluded, he said: &#8220;If I thought I had a chance
in the end, I would gladly wait a thousand years
for Polly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you won&#8217;t have to do that,&#8221; laughed
Anne. &#8220;In a few years, at the most, Polly will
want to get out of business, and settle down like
other girls&mdash;to a slave of a husband and a lovely
home of her own that she can decorate and enjoy
to her heart&#8217;s content.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom brightened up visibly at such alluring pictures,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
and promised to do exactly as Anne advised
him to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Polly pays no attention to you now, remember
it is because she is different from most
girls you have known. She was brought up at
Pebbly Pit ranch without any young companions,
until <i>we</i> went there that summer. She had a
yearning for the beautiful in art and other things,
but never had the slightest opportunity in the
Rocky Mountains, to further her ideals. The
only education she had had in the great and beautiful,
was when she was riding the peaks and could
study Nature in her grandest works.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you blame her, then, because she revels
in her studies and has no other desire, at present,
than that of reaching a plane where she can indulge
her talent and ideals? Can&#8217;t you see that
a youthful marriage to Polly, now seems like a
sacrifice of all she considers worth while in life?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom nodded understandingly as he listened to
Anne. And John added: &#8220;I told you Anne had
the right idea of this affair! Polly&#8217;s absolutely
safe, for a few years, from all love-tangles. And
when she begins to weary of hard work and disappointments
in business, then is your chance to
show her a different life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Tom,&#8221; quickly added Anne, &#8220;do not give
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Polly the opportunity, again, to suspect you of
lover-like intentions. Be a first-class brother to
her, and let <i>her</i> wonder if she has any further interest
in you. Never show your trump card to a
girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both men laughed at this sage advice, and John
nodded smilingly: &#8220;Anne ought to know, Tom.
That was the way she got me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anne was about to answer teasingly, when Mr.
Dalken came up and said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been hunting
you three everywhere. Hurry and get your
wraps, as the yacht is waiting to return to the
City.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The trio then learned that passes had been
granted the members in Mr. Fabian&#8217;s party, to
leave the steamer that night and go back with
their friends, on the yacht. So the cabin baggage
had been brought up to the gang-way, and when
Mr. Dalken summoned John and his companions
to come and help the girls get away, the boats
were already on their way to the yacht with the
luggage.
</p>
<p>Many of their fellow-passengers crowded about
the party when they were ready to go. Good-bys
were exchanged and the happy bevy of young
folks left. Then the boat returned for the older
members in the party, and soon the yacht was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
ready to fly back to her dock, up the River, near
72nd street. But the thick haze that had made
the moon look so romantic, developed into an impenetrable
fog. And anyone who has ever experienced
such a fog hanging over New York Harbor,
knows what it is to try to go through it.
</p>
<p>So the vessel had not traveled past the Statue
of Liberty, before the heavy pall of fog suddenly
dropped silently over the Bay, and anything
farther than a few feet away from the radius of
the electric lights on the boat, was completely
hidden.
</p>
<p>The Captain bawled forth orders to the crew
and instantly the uniformed men were running
back and forth to carry out the instructions. Before
all impetus to the yacht was closed down,
however, the engines had driven her into the route
generally used by the pilots of the boats running
to Staten Island.
</p>
<p>Captain Johnson anxiously studied his chart but
could not gauge his position exactly, because of
the dense fog and the lack of signals. In a few
minutes more, every fog-horn in the Bay and all
the great reflectors from guiding lights from bell-buoys
would be in full operation. But at the
time, there was nothing to tell him that he was
in a dangerous zone.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE ACCIDENT</h3>
</div>

<p>When the party reached the yacht, Mr.
Dalken said that chairs had been placed on the
forward deck where they could sit and watch the
scenes at night, as they sailed up to the City. So
all but Tom and Polly went forward and found
comfortable seats. Tom had asked Polly to
stroll about with him, and she, feeling guilty of
neglecting such an old friend when on the steamer,
consented.
</p>
<p>Thus it happened that Tom led her to the side
of the craft where they had climbed the ladder
to the deck, as this side was in shadow and farthest
from the group of friends who were seated
on the forward deck.
</p>
<p>But they had not promenaded up and down
many times, before the Captain gave anxious
commands to his crew. Every man jumped to
obey, instantly, while Tom and Polly halted in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
their walk just at the gap in the rail, where the
adjustable ladder had been lowered to the boat
when the passengers arrived from the steamer.
The steps had been hauled in but the sailor had
forgotten to replace the sliding rail. In the dense
fog this neglect had been overlooked.
</p>
<p>Immediately following the Captain&#8217;s shouts, a
great hulk loomed up right beside the yacht, and
a fearful blow to the rear end of the pleasure
craft sent her flying diagonally out of her path,
across the water. The collision made her nose
dip down dangerously while the stern rose up
clear of the waves.
</p>
<p>The group seated forwards slid together, and
some were thrown from their chairs, but managed
to catch hold of the ropes and rail to prevent being
thrown overboard.
</p>
<p>Polly and Tom, standing, unaware, so near the
open gap in the rail, still arm in arm as they had
been walking, were thrown violently side-ways
and there being nothing at hand to hold to, or to
prevent their going over the side, they fell into
the dark sea.
</p>
<p>Feeling as if the earth had dropped from under
her, Polly screamed in terror before her voice
was choked with water. Tom instinctively held
on to her arm, as he had been doing when the impact
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
of a larger vessel came upon the yacht, and
he maintained this grip as they both sank.
</p>
<p>Polly had always dreaded water, because it
seemed so unfamiliar to her. After living in the
mountains with only narrow roaring streams, or
the glacial lakes found in the Rockies, she had
never tried to swim in the ocean, but preferred
swimming in a pool. Consequently, this sudden
dive into the awesome black abyss so frightened
her, that she fainted before she could fight or
struggle.
</p>
<p>But Tom Latimer was an expert swimmer,
having won several medals while at College for
his continued swimming under water. At one
time during his first college days, he had saved
the lives of some young folks when their canoe
capsized a long distance from shore. In this supreme
test of ability and presence of mind, with
the girl he loved in his arms to save, Tom was
as self-possessed as if on deck with Polly.
</p>
<p>In less time than it takes to tell, both victims
of the collision sank until the natural fight between
the weight of the water and the force of
the air in their lungs, sent them up again to the
surface. In that short time, Tom used every
muscle and physical power to swim far enough
<i>under</i> the water to clear away from the boats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
which might do them more harm than the water.
</p>
<p>Fortunately he found the surface free when
he rose for breath, and finding no resistance from
the unconscious form he held, he managed to
change his grip from her arm to a firm hold under
the shoulders. In this position he could manage
to keep Polly&#8217;s head above water, and at the same
time, could swim backwards, by using his feet as
propellers.
</p>
<p>The only handicap he now had, was his clothing
and shoes; these interfered with his free action
in swimming so he managed to kick off his
dancing pumps. The greatest danger he feared,
was the sudden coming of some craft that would
compel him to dive again, or might even run them
down, unseen in the dark.
</p>
<p>But the very fog that had caused this accident,
also befriended them now, as no wary seaman
would recklessly go on his way in such a bewildering
mist, and the majority preferred waiting for
a temporary lifting of the blanket, before continuing
their journeys.
</p>
<p>Tom felt no concern over the fact that Polly
had fainted or had been in the water for a time,
for he knew she was so healthy that no ill would
occur to her from such causes. All he feared
now, was his power of endurance to keep floating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
until some craft might pick them up, or he could
reach a temporary rest.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt a sweeping current whirl him
about and in another moment, he was swimming
rapidly <i>with</i> instead of <i>against</i> the tide in the
Bay. He realized that in that short time the tide
had turned, either about some point of land, or
in the River. He began to tread water while he
tried to lift his head and gaze across the waves.
Then a broad shaft of dazzling light shot across
the Bay from a nearby reflector. At the same
time Tom heard the tolling of a bell-buoy, not
very far distant.
</p>
<p>He changed his course that the outgoing tide
would assist him in reaching this light that might
be coming from a ship, or maybe, from an island
in the Bay. As his powerful strokes carried him
along, the sound of the bell-buoy seemed to come
so plainly that he felt sure it was not far away.
If he could but hang on to it for a time, in order
to gain second wind!
</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a momentary lift of the
heavy fog, and he discovered he was quite near
Bedloe&#8217;s Island. The powerful search light had
reflected from the arc held aloft in the hand of
the Goddess of Liberty; and the light that danced
upon the waves all about him came from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
smaller arcs which were placed along the sea-wall
of the Island.
</p>
<p>The current now carried him helplessly past
the pier where the boats from the Battery land,
but just as he tried to lift his head once more and
yell for help, a motor boat was heard chugging
through the fog. His cry was heard by those in
the boat, and in a few moments the flash-light in
its prow was blinding Tom because of its
proximity.
</p>
<p>A chorus of amazed voices now mingled with
the noise of the water dashing against the wall
and the ringing of the buoy, and Tom began to
feel faint and dazed. But almost before he knew
what was happening, a powerful grip caught him
on his thick hair, and he was dragged partly out
of the water.
</p>
<p>A commanding voice shouted: &#8220;Help grab
the girl&mdash;we&#8217;ll take care of the man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Tom heard no more, nor indeed, knew
more until he indistinctly heard a far-off call of
&#8220;Guard! Guard!&#8221; Then he opened his eyes to
find he was on the solid earth, once more. Polly
was stretched out on the sand. The Guards
tumbled out of the barracks and rushed for the
spot where the officer stood calling.
</p>
<p>While a few of the boys lifted and half carried
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
Tom to the general assembly room, others
ran to assist the boatman with the girl. She was
carefully conveyed to the barracks and the doctor
sent for. Meantime the men applied the Schaefer
Method to both the strangers; Tom instantly recovered
himself fully but Polly&#8217;s faint lasted
longer.
</p>
<p>When the doctor hurried in, his kindly wife
followed. Tom was able to sit up and tell the
story of how the accident happened; then he
begged someone to notify the Wharf Police to
keep a lookout in the Harbor as there might be
a yacht in distress after that collision. Also, if
inquiry was made at Police Headquarters, the
news was to be given that both Polly and he were
safe on Liberty Island.
</p>
<p>A Corporal of the Guard was sent to attend
to these messages, and Tom was taken to a cot
in the ward of the Barracks. His wet clothing
was removed and he was rolled in a hot blanket
and given hot lemonade. In a few moments he
was sound asleep.
</p>
<p>Polly was taken to the doctor&#8217;s cottage where
his wife attended the patient as well as any trained
nurse could have done. The girl also was rolled
in warm blankets with hot-water bottles placed
about her cold body. Slowly she began to show
more animation, and when she could speak, she
asked if Tom was saved.

TOM AND POLLY ARE RESCUED.<br />
<i>Polly&#8217;s Business Venture.</i> <i>Page 39</i>
<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; you both are safe now,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And can we get word&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began she.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have taken care of that, too, dear. Now
try to drink this nice hot lemonade and then go
to sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly obediently drank the hot drink and sighed
in relief. Then she sank back and, almost instantly,
Nature claimed her rights to make up
for the unwonted interference with her customary
routine.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall sat beside the cot for some time
after Polly was asleep, but she finally succumbed
to weariness, and finding her patient fully recovered
and warm, she threw herself upon a nearby
cot.
</p>
<p>Both young people slept late in the morning,
and when Tom finally opened his eyes, feeling a
bit stiff in his joints, he had to collect his thoughts
to remember where he was. Like a flash, everything
came back, and he jumped up to dress and
find out how Polly was.
</p>
<p>His suit had been dried and pressed and hung
over a chair beside the cot. His dress-coat
seemed ridiculously out of order after that swim
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
and, now, for the morning&#8217;s work. But he smiled
as he donned the clothes, and started for the door
of the long room.
</p>
<p>Just as Tom reached the door one of the men
entered and greeted him warmly. &#8220;I see you&#8217;re
all right again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you. I hope the little girl is feeling
as well,&#8221; ventured Tom, anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Hall just left her and says she is right
as a fiddle. I&#8217;m the young fellow that telephoned
the Police for you. I got back word, early this
morning, that your folks finally got home, without
any harm to anyone. And say! Maybe there
wasn&#8217;t some joy when they heard you two were
safe with us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom felt a strange gripping at his throat, and
his voice quavered as he replied: &#8220;I <i>know</i> there
was!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man glanced at the evening dress
and then said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to loan you one of my
long coats to cover those togs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom responded gratefully, and said: &#8220;If I
can only do as much for you boys some time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; laughed the soldier, &#8220;don&#8217;t wish such an
experience on any of us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then both laughed. As they reached the house
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
where Polly had spent the night, the doctor
opened the door and smiled. When he saw that
Tom was feeling as good as ever, he said: &#8220;I
just hung up the &#8217;phone. A gentleman called
&#8216;Dalken&#8217; told me that they were all coming over
to take you away. But I warned him that the
entire party would be arrested if they landed on
Government Ground without a permit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I remembered that he might secure a
permit, so I said: &#8216;Anyway, before you people
can get here, my patients will be on their way to
the Battery.&#8217; I said that, because the young lady
ought to be kept perfectly quiet all morning, after
such a fearful experience, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; admitted Tom. &#8220;And I am
glad you said what you did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we had her dress dried and pressed, and
the little miss will be up and ready to thank you
for your courageous deed, in an hour or so,&#8221; explained
the doctor, significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ever so much!&#8221; said Tom, grasping
his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Ted, here, show you about the place and
entertain you until it&#8217;s time to call again,&#8221; suggested
the doctor.
</p>
<p>So Tom went away with his companion, not to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
explore the Island, but to go to the telephone and
have a long talk with his friends in the city, who
were anxious to hear about the accident.
</p>
<p>Just before noon, an orderly came to Tom to
say that Mrs. Hall said, &#8220;Mr. Latimer could call,
if he liked.&#8221; Tom laughed at the message&mdash;&#8220;if
he liked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he entered the little sitting-room of the doctor&#8217;s
house, Tom tiptoed as if he felt he had
to tread softly. But Polly sat in an arm-chair
by the window and saw him coming. She jumped
up and ran to the door to greet him, and Mrs.
Hall went out of the room by the kitchen-door.
</p>
<p>Tom was unable to speak a word when he
finally came into Polly&#8217;s presence. She caught
hold of his hands and shook them gladly, as she
cried: &#8220;Oh, Tom! What do I not owe you after
last night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom wanted to demand payment, but he knew
that would ruin his chances forever, so he held a
tight leash on his feelings and smiled wanly.
Then he said in an unnatural tone: &#8220;Lucky for
us both that I knew how to swim, eh, Polly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly was relieved to hear him speak in such a
way, but her next act was the outgrowth of spontaneous
gratitude. She flung both arms about his
neck and being too short to reach his cheek, kissed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
him on the chin as she would have done had he
been John. Tom trembled, but realized at the
same time, that Polly&#8217;s kiss meant nothing. Still
he was humbly grateful for even that token of
gratitude from the reserved girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now tell me, Tom dear, what did the folks
say about our sudden elopement?&#8221; Polly laughed
as she used the term.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Polly! I&#8217;d swim from here to China for
you if only it could be an elopement!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl instantly took alarm, and looked about
for Mrs. Hall. But Tom forced a laugh and
tried to make her believe he was joking. &#8220;Do
you think that any man would do <i>that</i> for a girl?&#8221;
he added.
</p>
<p>Then he hurried on to say that no one on the
yacht had been injured by the collision, but they
were hours in reaching their dock. He said that
they (Polly and Tom) were not missed at first,
and not until conditions had calmed down somewhat,
did Eleanor call for Polly. Then it was
found that neither Tom nor Polly were to be
found.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Eleanor who remembered seeing us
promenade along the side where the rail was detachable,
and it was Eleanor who said we must
have been thrown out where the steps came up.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
So the captain was taken to task for having such
a careless man on board, and both the man and
the captain were discharged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor man&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t his fault!&#8221; sighed Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you hadn&#8217;t recovered, I&#8217;d have sent
him to jail for life, because it was criminal negligence
to leave that rail open as it was!&#8221; was
Tom&#8217;s threatening reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad there is no cause for such harsh
treatment,&#8221; responded Polly.
</p>
<p>Tom gazed, with his soul in his eyes, as he
breathed fervently: &#8220;You&#8217;re not half as glad as
I am, darling!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly sprang away at that, and ran to the window,
saying: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we might start
for the City? Mrs. Hall went to fetch a hat
and wrap for me and she ought to be back by
this time.&#8221;

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A REUNION AND A VISITOR</h3>
</div>

<p>Never was maiden welcomed so enthusiastically
and so fervently, as Polly Brewster, that
morning when she stepped from the launch to the
sea-wall at Battery Park. Her father and mother
vied with each other in embracing and kissing
her, while the tears of happiness streamed from
their eyes; John and Anne hovered beside them,
watching every dear feature of Polly&#8217;s face.
Eleanor stood holding fast to her best friend&#8217;s
skirt, as if that could keep her forever near her.
</p>
<p>The members in the &#8220;Delegation of Welcome,&#8221;
acted as if they had been imbibing some intoxicating
stimulant. Such happy laughter, and vehement
demonstrations of joy and love because
Polly was with them again, spoke louder than
words that they had all thought she was drowned.
Tom found that little fuss was made over him in
the first exuberant greetings, but he came in for
his share after the doctor had concluded his story
about the valiant young rescuer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Brewster, you pay attention to
me,&#8221; remarked the physician, when he was ready
to depart on the launch: &#8220;You take your daughter
home, at once, and put her to bed for the rest
of the day, to spare her any nervous reaction.
Then, if she is all right tomorrow, you may allow
her to receive a caller, or two&mdash;no more for
the time being, or you will have her break down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Brewster promised to obey the orders
faithfully, and soon afterwards, Polly&#8217;s friends
followed her and her parents to the automobiles
which were waiting near the curb of the Park.
Tom was surrounded, on both sides and fore and
aft, by his family and John and Mr. Dalken, all
of whom wished to hear the thrilling story of the
rescue again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather hear how you folks kept afloat after
that boat rammed the yacht,&#8221; said he, shunning a
subject that still made him shudder.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken insisted that Tom with his father
and mother get into his luxurious limousine and
let him drive them home. On the way uptown,
Mr. Dalken told the story of their narrow escape
from being lost in the Bay after the collision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Immediately after the yacht was rammed and
we could collect our senses to comprehend what
had happened, and what to do, the old tub of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
ferry-boat kept on her course. But there were
some worried citizens on board, for they shouted
and, finally, the captain stopped his engines and
blew the whistles to see if we needed help.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately for us, a river tug was quite close
at hand when the accident occurred, and its captain
called through a megaphone to say that he
would assist us in any way we commanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Captain then ascertained that part of our
gear had been shaken out of place, and it would
be dangerous for him to try to run the vessel under
her own power, and trust our steering gear.
So the good old man on the tug took us in tow
and landed us, towards dawn, at our dock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The moment we were on land, I rushed to
the telephone at the Yacht Club house, and notified
Police Headquarters. Ken Evans was an
eye-witness to the dive that we feared had cost
Polly and you your lives; so we told the Sergeant
at the Station just about where you went down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bureau at Battery Park was &#8217;phoned but
they said the tide was running out at that time,
so you both would be carried past Bedloe&#8217;s Island;
if you both were good swimmers there was
a slight hope of your being rescued.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Tom, we were almost frantic with
joy and relief when word came from Liberty Island
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
that you both were safe in bed, there, without
injury or other hurt, excepting the shock.
Polly&#8217;s mother swooned and we thought she was
gone because it was so long before we could revive
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s mother sat holding her boy&#8217;s hand within
her own, and his father smiled at him so often
that Tom began to feel fussed. But Mr. Dalken
laughed at his apparent self-consciousness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, my boy, grin and bear this ordeal for
the time, as you may never in your life, have another
experience like it. It shows you what we
all think of you, to sit and idolize you in this
fashion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They laughed at the banter, but Tom felt more
at ease after Mr. Dalken&#8217;s little speech.
</p>
<p>Having arrived at his home, Tom rebelled
against being kept quiet that day. &#8220;Goodness&#8217;
sakes, mother! any one would think I was an invalid.
Why, I feel better than I have in
months!&#8221; and his happy gayety attested to his
spirits. But no one knew that he was joyous because
Polly had kissed him that morning. And
he was sure that that <i>something</i> he had detected
in her eyes, was the awakening of love, instead
of the fervent gratitude it really was.
</p>
<p>Tom could not settle down to do anything that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
day, but he called John up on the &#8217;phone several
times to ask about Polly. John patiently replied
each time, that Polly was fast asleep and would
probably remain so, for several hours more, because
she required it. When Tom asked if he
had better come down that evening and call, John
was most emphatic in his refusal.
</p>
<p>But the following day, Tom kept telephoning
the Brewsters every little while and Anne finally
capitulated and invited him to call that evening.
</p>
<p>Polly was fully recovered again, with no signs
of the shock or soaking she had received; so,
when Tom was announced by the telephone girl
in the hotel office, she felt no undue nervousness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anne, you are going to help entertain Tom,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; said she, casually patting her hair
down neatly.
</p>
<p>Anne looked at her sister-in-law with an amused
smile. &#8220;If you think you will need a chaperone
when such an old friend calls. Tom always
seems more like a brother than a young man who
might turn out to be a beau, some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly pondered this sentence for a time, then
said: &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no telling what he may
think after that ducking, you know, so it will be
more comfortable to have you about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom fully expected a warm welcome from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
Polly, and perhaps, another flash of something
akin to love that he thought he had detected in
her deep blue eyes, when he met her in the hospital.
So he was more than chagrined to find
Polly smile friendily upon him as she took his hand
in the same manner that she would have taken
Mr. Dalken&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I just thought I would bring in a little glow
with me, Polly,&#8221; remarked Tom, when he recovered
self-possession again. &#8220;A few roses, such
as I know you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He handed a long box to Polly and watched
eagerly as she cut the string and opened the lid
of the box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom! American Beauties again! How
lovely!&#8221; and she buried her face in the fragrant
red petals that filled the one end of the box.
</p>
<p>Anne held out her hand for the box when Polly
went to place it on a chair. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hand them to
mother, Polly, for her to arrange in a jar. The
others that came yesterday, can be placed in another
glass.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did Polly receive other roses?&#8221; asked
Tom, trying to appear unconcerned, but flushing
as he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, didn&#8217;t you send them to me? There
was no card in the box, but you always send American
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
Beauties, Tom,&#8221; exclaimed Polly, in surprise.
</p>
<p>Tom laughed sheepishly. &#8220;Well, I did send
them, Polly, but I thought I would make you
guess who it could have been. I never dreamed
you would give me credit for the roses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I? It would have seemed
queer if you hadn&#8217;t sent flowers, when everyone
within a thousand miles, sent boxes and bouquets
to me, all yesterday and all day today.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They did! What for?&#8221; asked Tom, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for? Why, goodness me! Don&#8217;t you
suppose my friends were <i>glad</i> that I wasn&#8217;t
drowned,&#8221; retorted Polly, in amazement.
&#8220;Everyone that ever knew me, sent love and
flowers, so I never thought it strange that you sent
me some, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was a hard slap for Tom, and he winced
under the words which denoted that Polly considered
him only as one of many friends. Even the
roses presented that night, with a little heart-shaped
card tied in the center of the group of
stems, now seemed useless in his eyes.
</p>
<p>But Polly had not removed the roses from the
box so she failed to find the heart-shaped card that
Tom had spent the whole afternoon in inditing.
Anne gave the box to Mrs. Brewster, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
that sensible mother took the roses out, one by
one, and found the card, she put it away with the
cards that had come with other flowers. She
also forgot to mention the card to Polly, so the
girl never knew that Tom had written her of his
undying love. As Anne replied, for Polly, to all
the cards, Tom received the same sort of polite
little note as others did, with Polly&#8217;s name and a
&#8220;per A.B.&#8221; signed to it.
</p>
<p>Finding Polly so self-possessed that evening,
Tom pulled himself together with an effort, and
tried to converse on various topics of general interest.
Anne eagerly assisted in the conversation,
so Polly listened without having much to say.
</p>
<p>Tom tried to make Polly talk, too, but without
success, so he became silent and left most of
the entertaining for Anne to do. But even she
found the task of finding subjects to interest two
dumb people rather irksome, and she decided on
a <i>coup</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me for a moment, please, while I see
if John has returned with his father.&#8221; So saying,
Anne ran from the room.
</p>
<p>Polly sat up and watched her go as if her protector
had turned traitor. She glanced at Tom
in a half doubtful manner as if to ask what he
would do now with the chaperone out of the way?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>But Anne&#8217;s absence gave Tom&#8217;s morbid senses
an inspiration that he acted upon without second
thought. It was the best thing he could have
done with Polly in this baffling mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m returning to Pebbly Pit, in a few days,
Polly. I am actually homesick for a sight of the
dear old mountains.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly gasped. &#8220;Oh, no one told me you were
leaving us. Jim told me that he thought you
might remain here for several months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim? What does that kid know about my
affairs?&#8221; said Tom, impatiently. &#8220;Besides, when
did you see Jim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim just dropped in for a minute this
afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom felt the pangs of jealousy because his
younger brother had been able to see Polly before
she would allow him to call. Then he remembered
his rôle to act the part of a platonic
brother and friend.
</p>
<p>Polly continued: &#8220;I think Jim is a dear boy.
He is so fond and proud of you, too. Why, when
he was here he sat and talked of nothing else but
you and your loyalty to family, friends, and your
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Polly spoke, Tom felt ashamed of his momentary
jealousy of his brother. When she had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
finished speaking, he laughed and said: &#8220;What
a pity Jim sees me through such fine magnifying
glasses. The undesirable qualities in my character
he never detects.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is great to have your family think
you are all that is wonderful! I think my family
regard me as a saint, and I like it, too,&#8221; declared
Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you are one, Polly dear,&#8221; retorted
Tom, and the fervor he expressed in his
eyes and voice, caused his companion to gasp.
</p>
<p>Before Tom could follow up his sudden declaration
and make Polly understand his sentiments
for her, she broached another subject of conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, what has been accomplished at the mine
and at Rainbow Cliffs while I was in Europe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom frowned, but he realized that Polly was
more sensible than he. He remembered, once
more, what Anne had advised, so he choked the
despondent sigh and replied instead, with seeming
interest:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, John and I had another queer bout with
some thieves. They were not after the land this
time, but they planned to get at the ore and carry
off as much of the gold as they could lay hands
on. Our old friend, Rattlesnake Mike, caught
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
them red-handed, and now they are serving a term
in prison at hard labor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom! I never heard a word of this!&#8221;
cried Polly, eagerly. &#8220;Do tell me about it.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE RAID ON CHOKO&#8217;S FIND MINE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You remember when we all came East last
June to attend John&#8217;s wedding and see you off for
Europe?&#8221; asked Tom.
</p>
<p>Polly nodded eagerly but said nothing to interrupt
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we remained longer than we had
planned when we left Pebbly Pit. The friends in
New York were so eager to entertain us before
we went back home, that the days passed swiftly
before we realized we had stayed on ten days
longer than we should have done at that time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now to go back to the time when those two
rascals tried to jump your claim, the time your
father and Mike guided the party when you-all
climbed the Indian Trail to Grizzly Slide.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that crafty clerk who had copied the
rough map of the claim you staked on Flat Top
and filed in Oak Creek, never gave up hope of
some day getting his hands on enough of that gold
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
to help him get away and live comfortably, ever
after, on the proceeds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When he learned that everyone of the family
at Pebbly Pit, would be East for a few weeks, and
the mine would be left in charge of Mike and the
other employees, he immediately called a few cut-throats
together and laid his plans accordingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After the discovery of his perfidy in copying
the claim papers and then trying to jump the
staked claim, he had been discharged from the
office in Oak Creek and, thereafter, no one respectable
would employ him. So he hung about
the saloon and spent his time in gambling with
the miners from Up-Crest, back of Oak Creek
station. He found willing confederates in this
group of Slavs who hailed the invitation to steal
enough gold to enable them to go back to Europe
and pose as rich men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole plot had been kept unusually secret
for that species of foreigner, so no one at Oak
Creek knew of the proposed raid. But Mike
rode into Oak Creek the morning before the night
these rascals planned to act, and with his unusual
gift of intuition, he felt that something was working
quietly in the minds of the evil-looking men he
found whispering over a small table in one corner
of the saloon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mike hung around for several hours to try
and learn if any plot was hatching against Rainbow
Cliffs while the owners were absent; or perhaps
these men planned a rush on the mine while
he and but few men were on guard. But nothing
could be discovered. Feeling assured because
of the sly and malicious expressions of the men
at the table when they glanced at Mike, as he sat
in another corner and pretended to doze, that
Hank had some move under way to trouble him
and his assistants, made the Indian use splendid
judgment and action that day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He borrowed the Sheriff&#8217;s thoroughbred bloodhound,
and asked for a few extra men to accompany
him to the cave and stay there until the owners
returned, promising them better wages than
they could earn at any work in Oak Creek, or on
the ranches nearby. To allay suspicion he rode
out of town, alone, but he had agreed to wait at
Pine Tree Blaze for the extra men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men rode away from town each at a
different time, to avoid talk or notice by the
loungers at the saloon, and all met at the rendezvous
that afternoon. Mike then led the way
up the steep trail, and by dark they were in
camp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the second day after we left Pebbly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Pit. Mike had warned Jeb of his suspicions, too,
and that wary little man had instantly taken steps
to protect the Cliffs, by ordering all hands working
there to keep away from Oak Creek until the
Boss got home. He said that unusual care must
be used for a time, to watch during the nights,
and keep trespassers out during the day, for fear
of raiders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first night in camp on the mountains,
Mike never rested a minute, but moved silently
from one place to another, with senses keyed for
some sign of the rascals. However, that first
night passed quietly away. His extra men spent
the evening in smoking and playing cards, then
they rolled up in their blankets and snored peacefully
the night through.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next day Mike smiled to himself when
the men laughed at his suspicions. They were so
far from any settlement and the mountains were
so great and silent, that it gave them confidence
in the peace and good will with all men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The second night the men were again playing
cards near the camp-fire. Mike sat on the ledge
in front of the cave with the hound stretched out
on a slab of rock at his feet. The giant wooden
flume could be faintly discerned, through the
smoke of the fire and from the pipes of the men,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
not twenty feet away from the engines that
worked it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly the hound lifted his head and pointed
his ears. Mike leaned forward with face turned
towards the flume, listening. Then he laid his
pipe down on the rock and crawled away upon
his hands and knees, followed closely by the
hound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the giant flume we planned
to carry off the water of the river that flowed
underground; the one into which Nolla and you
dropped the torch the day you found the cave?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly silently signified that she remembered, and
Tom continued: &#8220;Well, we used that flume during
the work of mining and washing trash from
the ore, but at night, when there was no need for
the water to pour through it, we turned the current
down the other way on the opposite side of
the mountain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike crept silently across the ledge and
peered far down into the black chasm below, to
ascertain if the suspicious sounds came from that
pit. But the dog crawled noiselessly across the
ledge to the flume and there he stood with tense
nerves. His ears were erect and his tail was
standing out straight behind him, as he stood and
glared at the wooden flume.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As the dog was so well-trained, Mike did not
doubt his instinct, but crept over to his side and
there waited and listened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had he not been absolutely quiet, the faint
sound of something moving inside that flume
would have been lost on the outside. But Mike
was as keen a hunter as his dog, and they both
sensed that something very foreign to water was
passing through that flume.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Accompanying the strange muffled sound inside
the flume every few moments, there came a
different sound, as if something sharp was being
driven into the wood for a hold. Mike figured
out that the inside of the flume had been worn so
slippery with the flood of waters and sand or
pebbles passing through it in torrents, that
it was necessary to use steel-pointed staffs and
creepers to help anyone in the dangerous
ascent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as Mike felt convinced that someone
was trying a new trick to gain possession of the
mine, he crept back to the camp-fire and told the
men of the sounds inside the flume. They
laughed immoderately at Mike, and declared that
he was going mad because of his prohibition since
his employers left him in charge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mike ordered a few of his most trustworthy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
miners to guard the cave in front, while
the others were sent over the top of the range to
keep watch at the opposite entrance to the mine.
You&#8217;ll remember, Polly, that that was the side
where the pit cut the cave in half. We bridged
that chasm, you know, and used the short-cut entrance
quite often, although the ore was brought
out through Choko&#8217;s Find.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike then selected several of his brawniest
fighters and very quietly led the way to the opening
of the flume where the water-gate was located.
As they could travel faster on the ground than
the men creeping up inside the slippery wooden
tube, Mike and his companions reached the water-gate
before they heard the suspicious sounds
from within the flume.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He signalled his men to keep absolutely quiet,
and then crept out on the lintel of the gate and
got a firm purchase on the lever. No one
dreamed of his purpose at the moment, and he
suddenly seemed to reconsider his plan, for he
crept back again and had just reached the trio of
curious men, when a sigh of relief was distinctly
heard from inside the flume.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then a whispering was heard, but not understood.
In a few moments a grating sound as if
some sharp tool was being used. Mike surmised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
that they were trying to break a way through the
wooden door by which to get out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Without further delay, then, Mike threw
open the lid in the top of the flume and commanded
the trespassers to come forth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no reply from within, and not a
sound was heard after Mike opened the lid. So
he called again: &#8216;Ef yoh no come us wash riber
fru dis pipe.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still no reply or sound was heard, so Mike
winked at his companions, and gave a fictitious
order: &#8216;Frow water gate open!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stop! Wait a minute!&#8217; shouted a frightened
voice from the flume.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another voice cursed in the most dreadful
way, but soon after Mike&#8217;s order to turn in the
water, four men managed to emerge from the tube
and sit astride it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seeing but four opponents there to fight, the
leader of the gang gave a sign, and the daring
raiders tried to over-power Mike and his three
men. But they had not seen the wolf-hound in
the shadows. As they dropped upon the men to
fight them, the dog sprang out and drove his
fangs deep into one rascal&#8217;s throat. He will
carry those marks to his last day. It was a wonder
he was not killed outright.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That released Mike and he turned his attention
to help his companions free themselves. The
dog fought mightily, and after a short but fierce
battle, the trespassers were bound and laid on the
ground for the night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;cha goin&#8217; to do wid&#8217;dem, Mike?&#8217; asked
one of his men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ship &#8217;em down th&#8217; flume, Mike, th&#8217; way they
come up,&#8217; laughed another of his men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;So me say, but Mike go jail fer kill man,&#8217;
replied the Indian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The other men strongly approved of that
course of justice, however, and Mike had all he
could do to keep them from following their inclination
to wash the guilty men down the flume
and out into Bear Forks River at the foot of the
mountain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next day Mike and his men drove the
raiders down the steep trail and left them in the
hands of the constable of Oak Creek, to await
trial in the County Court. But the captured rascals
had boon companions in Oak Creek, and
when they learned that four of their group were
in prison they started a regular riot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They tarred and feathered poor little Jeb the
next time he drove in to Oak Creek for mail and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
supplies, and a few days before we got back home,
they made a well-planned raid on the lava mines
at Rainbow Cliffs. Not a piece of machinery
was left intact, and the great bags of jewels we
had waiting for shipment were scattered far and
wide by the vandals.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the sheriff heard of the proposed visit to
Pebbly Pit, and took a possé of men to follow the
drunken miners to the Cliffs. Such a battle as
ensued, beggars my weak description. The sheriff
told us about it when we got home, but his
language is not very graphic, nor is it thrilling, so
we only heard the bare facts of the fight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Polly, you must supply with your own
vivid imagination, the details that may be missing
from my account. When I tell you that the vandals
were slowly backed away from the Cliffs
and were, eventually, driven to the gully back of
the Devil&#8217;s Causeway where those two men were
engulfed in the slide, the day they came to cajole
your father into signing papers for the Cliffs, you
can picture their horror when the edge of the
great cliff began to crumble in. They could not
turn to right or left, as they were hemmed in by
the pursuers, and they dared not remain where
they were for fear of being swallowed in the quicksand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
that was already sliding downwards. So
they gave up to the sheriff and surrendered their
guns.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a bad case, as one of the sheriff&#8217;s
men had been dangerously wounded and it was
feared he would die. All our valuable machinery
was ruined and all orders for the delivery of
the lava jewels had to be cancelled, or postponed
for a year. So the culprits each got twenty years
and Oak Creek is quieter, by far, because more
than a score of its worst citizens are safely housed
in jail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Tom ended his story, Polly unclasped her
hands which she had nervously clenched during
the recital of the raids on her precious property.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom! I never dreamed of all the trouble
everyone would have because of those precious
mines, the day Nolla and I filed our papers at Oak
Creek,&#8221; gasped Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one does dream of these things&mdash;they only
see the future in rosy hues,&#8221; retorted Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think of the work and worry John and
you have had in establishing this great undertaking,
while I was in Europe taking life easy, and
spending money without a thought of how it was
being produced at home!&#8221; sighed Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is as it should be, Polly. You were not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
squandering the money, but using it in ways to
profit yourself for the future. John and I knew,
when we started in on this mining venture, that
the line would not lay in flower-strewn paths, but
that it might force us over all sorts of snags, before
we reached success.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is fine of you to talk like this, Tom,&#8221;
admitted Polly, gratefully. &#8220;If it were not for
you boys taking an interest in the work, I might
as well say &#8216;good-by&#8217; to the gold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom laughed. &#8220;Polly, this is so insignificant
a work to do for you&mdash;just taking an interest in
your mine. Some day I hope to prove in some
greater way, just what I want to, and can, do
for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s manner and looks again alarmed Polly
and she changed the subject adroitly. &#8220;Tom, do
you like the home in Pebbly Pit? Isn&#8217;t it different
from living in the city, in these apartments?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom smiled, for he understood. &#8220;Yes, it is
fine, Polly. It is a real home&mdash;with your blessed
mother at the ranch-house. I have lived in adobe
huts in Arizona, and out on sand wastes in New
Mexico, you know, so that Pebbly Pit is great,
in comparison.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother told me how good it was to have
Anne and you with her all summer, while I was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
abroad,&#8221; said Polly, after a short interval of silence.
&#8220;I feel that it was not so heartless of me
to enjoy myself in Europe as I did, so long as
mother and father were not lonely and homesick
for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But your mother often said to me, that were
it not for Anne&#8217;s being with her, she would have
cabled you to come home. She had looked forward
so anxiously to your spending this vacation
at Pebbly Pit,&#8221; remarked Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My! Then I was more fortunate than I
dreamed of,&#8221; laughed Polly. &#8220;I should have
hated to leave Eleanor in Europe, with such a
wonderful tour before us, and come back home
without having done the whole trip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom had no desire to hear more about that enjoyable
tour and the probable acquaintance the
girls had made with eligible young men with fascinating
titles. So he spoke of his imminent departure
for the West.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a talk with Dad and Mr. Dalken today,
and they think it best for me to get back at
the mines without further delay. The mountain
storms will soon be sweeping over the peaks, and
winter protection must be completed at the Cave
and Flume before then; so I think I shall be leaving
in a day, or so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>Polly murmured some friendly regret at his
going so soon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the need of my being at the mines to prepare
for winter is not the main cause of my leaving
New York, so soon,&#8221; began Tom, moodily.
&#8220;I came East with a definite hope in mind, but so
many unforeseen events have happened since I met
you, that I haven&#8217;t furthered my interests since I
left Pebbly Pit.&#8221; Tom waited for encouragement
from Polly.
</p>
<p>Polly did not pursue the subject, however, but
she said: &#8220;Well, this winter, I have planned to
actually <i>work</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you said you have been working
ever since you came to New York,&#8221; laughed Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, at school and in other ways; but now, I
propose going to work in Mr. Ashby&#8217;s shop.
You know, he has a wonderful place on Fifth
Avenue where they have every kind of article one
needs in the way of ornament or decorating.
There is where Eleanor and I managed to get
such splendid experience in textiles and other objects
familiar to interior decorators.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I propose going to work for him at a
stated salary, and giving every morning to the
work, this year. In the afternoons I will be free
to visit Exhibitions, Museums, hunt up antiques,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
or just play. Four evenings every week we will
attend school and lectures, you know, so there
will not be very much time left in which to write
letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never did work hard at writing letters,&#8221;
said Tom, smilingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and this winter there will be even less
time for them. My friends will have to be satisfied
with picture post-cards or telegrams,&#8221;
laughed Polly, hoping that would answer all expected
requests for a correspondence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I only write to people I
really want to hear from. And I never ask anyone
to write to me unless I take a great deal of
pleasure in reading their letters. I never asked
you to correspond with me, have I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o, I think not,&#8221; replied Polly, disconcerted
at this announcement. She had felt sure he was
going to beg her to write as often as possible, and
now this was so different!
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought not! You see our likes and pursuits
are so different. The very difference in our
ways of living now&mdash;you with luxurious art in
New York, me in the rugged life of a miner in
the Rockies, creates a gulf between our ideals.
Mine is getting at gold that is the basis of most
worldly success, and yours is an ideal and aspiration
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
in art that transcends my common work and
business. So we would not know what to say to
each other in letters, would we? You would not
wish to speak of gold and mining, and I haven&#8217;t
any idea of art or its ideals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>What it must have cost Tom to say all this,
no one knows, but he was piqued, at last, and so
acted his part admirably; and he had the satisfaction
of seeing that Polly felt sorry at his words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, I always felt sure you were an idealist
at soul. It makes me feel a deep regret to learn
that you have no such ideals left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom bid Polly good-by without an outward
sign of regret, and so she sat and pondered over
that unusual fact, long after he had gone.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>POLLY AND ELEANOR BEGIN COLLECTING</h3>
</div>

<p>Within a week after the westerners had gone
back home, matters with Polly and her friends in
New York settled down in a smooth current.
The Fabians found a commodious house in a refined
environment quite near the Ashby&#8217;s home,
and the two girls, Polly and Eleanor, lived with
them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fabian temporarily resumed his lectureship
at the Art School of Cooper Union, and his
two promising pupils, with Dodo Alexander as
a new beginner, accompanied him every night that
the classes met.
</p>
<p>The Alexanders had leased an expensive suite
at an apartment hotel near the Fabians, and much
to little Mr. Alexander&#8217;s joy, although much to
Mrs. Alexander&#8217;s disgust, they settled down to
a hum-drum life that winter. She sighed as she
referred to her life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear sakes! Here I am with all this money
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
to spend on a fine time, and I have to waste my
days sitting around hearing Dodo rave about
Corunthian Columns, Ionack Piers, and such foolish
stuff. As for Ebeneezer! He is just impossible
to get along with, since he found what quiet
friends he had in the Fabians and the Ashbys!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The result of such complaints from Mrs. Alexander
were soon evidenced by her spending her
evenings at theatres, dances at various clubs and
places she had forced an entrance to, and in daily
shopping trips about the city.
</p>
<p>The motley collection of antiques the girls had
secured while abroad and had shipped home, arrived
in due season and the cases were sent to Mr.
Ashby&#8217;s Shop. The girls were told that the
goods had been delivered, and the next day they
hastened to the establishment to admire their
purchases.
</p>
<p>The articles were arranged in one small room,
and when the three girls followed Mr. Ashby to
the place, they were amazed at the insignificance
of their exhibition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! I thought I had a lot of stuff,&#8221; declared
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see all that you bought. There is your
list,&#8221; laughed Mr. Ashby, sympathizing in her
disillusionment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I thought that chest so much more elaborate&mdash;when
I chose it in France,&#8221; ventured Polly,
puckering her forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why,&#8221; said Mr. Ashby. &#8220;When
we see these pieces on the other side, the glamour
of the places and the stories connected with them,
actually charm us more than the objects themselves.
After we secure our desires and find we
own them, we ship them home and do not see them
again until they reach prosaic and business-like
New York.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meantime, we enhance the beauty and romance
of the objects we purchased, by thinking
of them in connection with the romance of their
past; thus idealizing them in mental pictures, they
appear far finer and more alluring than in truth
they are.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When we really view them again, just as you
are now doing, the shock of finding them just
simple antiques, and so inferior to what we
dreamed them, reverses our sentiments about
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now beware, girls! Don&#8217;t let this reversal affect
you, in the least. These objects are just as
valuable and desirable, here, as ever they were
over there. It is only your personal view-point
that has changed, somewhat. You have not been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
visiting old collections, or museums abroad, for
some weeks now; and the radical change from
touring ancient Europe, to rushing about in New
York in quests of homes, school, and clothes for
the season, has made a corresponding change in
your minds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a short time, you will be back in harness
and feel the same keen delight in these old possessions
as aforetime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly appreciated the sense of Mr. Ashby&#8217;s little
lecture, but Eleanor still felt disappointed with
her purchases. And Dodo laughed outright at
the old pewter she had gone wild over in England,
and now scorned in America.
</p>
<p>That evening Mr. Fabian explained, carefully,
about the times and customs of the purchases that
represented certain people. He wove a tale of
romance about each piece of furniture the girls
had delighted in, and enhanced their interest in
the dishes and other small objects they had collected
that summer, until the three disappointed
owners felt a renewed attraction in the articles.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ashby was present, but he said nothing
until Mr. Fabian had ended. Then he added in
a suggestive manner: &#8220;Fabian, what do you say
to the girls taking short trips to the country, each
week, to hunt up such antiques as can be found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
in out-of-the-way nooks all through New
England?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls perked up their ears at this, and
waited to hear Mr. Fabian&#8217;s reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they had a car and someone to accompany
them on such excursions, I think they would thoroughly
enjoy it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dalken has three cars&mdash;two limousines, you
know; and he told me that he wished he could prevail
upon the girls to make use of one, instead of
his leaving it in a garage to eat up its value in rent.
I thought of this way to give the girls many interesting
quests, and make use of the car at the
same time, so I mentioned it to him. He was delighted
and wants the girls to try the plan,&#8221; explained
Mr. Ashby.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I will offer myself as chaperone,&#8221; hastily
added Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only be included in these outings I
should love it,&#8221; laughed Nancy Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are! Any one who belongs to us, must
consider themselves as invited,&#8221; said Polly,
laughingly.
</p>
<p>So an outing for Saturday was planned, that
night, and Mrs. Fabian and Nancy were to manage
the details for the girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will choose a likely country-side for our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
first trial,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Fabian, looking at her
husband for advice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s hard sense,&#8221; laughed he. &#8220;But where
is such a spot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere in New England,&#8221; ventured
Nancy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as ambiguous as &#8216;Somewhere in
France,&#8217;&#8221; retorted Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not when you consider that New England
begins just the other side of the city-line of Portchester,&#8221;
said Mr. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are no antiques to be found in Rye,
Portchester or Greenwich, in these days of amateur
collectors hunting over those sections,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not limited to those nearby towns;
but you can travel fifty miles in the inland sections
in a short time, and stop at simple little farm-houses
to inquire, as we did this summer while
touring England. I wager you&#8217;ll come home with
enough trophies of war to start you off again, in
a day or two,&#8221; explained Mr. Fabian.
</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, Mrs. Fabian packed an
auto-kit with delectable sandwiches, cakes and
other dainties, and the party of amateur collectors
started out on their quest. The chauffeur
smiled at their eagerness to arrive at some place
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
on the Boston Post Road that might suggest that
it led to their Mecca. He kept on, however, until
after passing through Stamford, then he turned
to the left and followed a road that seemed to
leave all suburban life behind, in a very short
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you taking us, Carl?&#8221; asked Polly,
curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On a road that Mr. Ashby told me about.
He has never stopped at these places, but he
thinks you will find something, along here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After several more miles had been reeled off,
the eager and watchful passengers in the car
glimpsed a low one-story farm-house, with plenty
of acreage around it. The two-story box-like addition
built at the rear and hooked up to the tiny
dwelling that almost squatted on the road itself,
seemed to apologise for the insignificance of its
mother-house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Slow up, Carl. Let&#8217;s look this place over,&#8221;
called Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>The automobile came to a stop and the ladies
leaned out to inspect the possibilities in such an
old place. A girl of ten came around the corner
of the box-house and stood gazing at the people
in the car.
</p>
<p>Carl seemed to be no novice in this sort of outing,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
and he called to the girl: &#8220;Hey! Is your
mudder home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl nodded without saying a word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Tell her to come out, a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian hastily interpolated with: &#8220;Oh,
we&#8217;d better go in and ask for a drink, Carl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Carl laughed. &#8220;Just as you say, Missus. But
dese farmer people don&#8217;t stand on fussin&#8217;.
You&#8217;se can ask her right out if she wants to sell
any old thing she&#8217;s got in the attic or cellar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Polly, smilingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause Mr. Dalken got the fever of collectin&#8217;
after you folks went to Urope. And many a time
I&#8217;ve sat and laughed at his way of getting things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! That&#8217;s why you knew where to drive
us, eh?&#8221; said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, &#8217;cause he never come this road, yet. He
mapped it out, once, and said he would try it some
day. That&#8217;s why he told me which road to foller
today.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl had disappeared but was coming back
by this time. She climbed upon the picket gate
and hung over it, as she called out: &#8220;My ma&#8217;s
kneadin&#8217; bread an&#8217; can&#8217;t get out, this minit.
She says if you want somethun, fer you to come
in and see <i>her</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This invitation sufficed for all five to instantly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
get out of the car and lift the latch on the gate.
The girl never budged from her perch, but permitted
the visitors to swing her back as the gate
was opened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go right to the side door,&#8221; advised she, holding
on to the pickets.
</p>
<p>As invited, the collectors went to the side door
and Mrs. Fabian knocked timidly. &#8220;Come in!&#8221;
said a shrill voice from within.
</p>
<p>The lady of the house had plump arms elbow-deep
in dough. She glanced up and nodded in a
business-like manner. &#8220;Did yer come fer fresh
aigs?&#8221; asked she, punching the dough positively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have any for sale, I should like to take
a dozen,&#8221; returned Mrs. Fabian, politely. Polly
and Dodo stared in surprise at their chaperone,
but Eleanor and Nancy comprehended at once,
why this reply was made.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, will yuh, and I&#8217;ll get this job
off my hands afore I go fer the aigs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed humorously as she remarked:
&#8220;It looks like dough on your hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman laughed appreciatively, while the
others smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s right! It&#8217;s dough, all
right. I s&#8217;pose you folks are from nearby, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very far away,&#8221; returned Mrs. Fabian.
&#8220;We are out on a pleasure jaunt this morning,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
but I saw your farm and so we decided to ask
your little girl if you were in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! I tole my man to put a sign
out on the letter-box fer passers-by to see how I
had aigs to sell; but he is that procrastinatin&#8217;&mdash;he
puts off anythun&#8217; &#8217;til it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman was scraping the bits of dough
from her hands as she spoke, and this done, she
sprinkled flour over the top of the soft lump in
the pan and covered it with a piece of old linen
cloth. As she took it to a warm corner behind
the stove, she added: &#8220;Do you&#8217;se know! Abe
was late fer our weddin&#8217;. But I knew him for
procrastinatin&#8217;, even in them days, so I made
everyone wait. He come in an &#8217;nour behind time,
sayin&#8217; he had to walk from his place &#8217;cause his
horse was too lame to ride. That&#8217;s Abe all over,
in everythun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The house-keeper finished her task and turned
to her callers. &#8220;Now then! Do yuh like white
er brown aigs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;White ones, please,&#8221; returned Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>The woman went to the large storeroom off
the kitchen and counted out a dozen eggs in a
box. When she came back she held them in one
hand while waiting for payment, with outstretched
other hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fine sofa you&#8217;ve got in the next
room,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Fabian, pretending not to
notice the open palm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh, d&#8217;ye know, I paid fifteen dollars jus&#8217; fer
that red plush alone?&#8221; declared she, going to the
door and turning to invite her visitors to come
in. The box of eggs was forgotten for the
time.
</p>
<p>The girls followed Mrs. Fabian to the best
room that opened from the large kitchen, and
to their horror they saw that the sofa referred
to was a hideous Victorian affair of walnut frame
upholstered in awful red mohair plush.
</p>
<p>But Mrs. Fabian made the most of her optics
the moment she got inside the room. Thus it
happened that she spied a few little ornaments
on the old mantel-shelf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What old-fashioned glass candle-sticks,&#8221; said
she, going over to look at the white-glass holders
with pewter sockets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t they awful! I&#8217;ve told Abe, many a
time, that I&#8217;d throw them out, some day, and get
a real nice bankit lamp fer the center table,&#8221; returned
the hostess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And won&#8217;t he throw them away?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Fabian, guilelessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says, why should we waste &#8217;em, when they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
comes in so handy, in winter, to carry down cellar
fer apples. He likes &#8217;em cuz he onny paid a
quarter fer &#8217;em an&#8217; a glass pitcher, at an auction,
some miles up the road. But that wuz so long
ago we&#8217;ve got our money&#8217;s wuth outen them.
Now I wants a brass lamp an&#8217; he says I&#8217;m gettin&#8217;
scandalous in my old age&mdash;awastin&#8217; money on
flim-flams fer the settin&#8217; room. He says lamps is
fer parlor use.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her repressed aspirations in furnishings made
the woman pity herself, but Mrs. Fabian took advantage
of the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve needed a pair of candle-sticks for some
time, and I&#8217;ll exchange a lamp for your auction
bargain which you say has paid for itself, by this
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Don&#8217;t you want your lamp?&#8221; exclaimed
the lady, aghast at such a statement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have no further use for one, and it
would look lovely on your marble-top table,&#8221; returned
Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well! How long will it take you to
get it from home?&#8221; asked the woman, anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you really wish to get rid of the candle-sticks
and jug, I&#8217;ll leave the quarter you paid originally
for them and go for the lamp at once.
Maybe I can be back in an hour&#8217;s time. I&#8217;ll pay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
for the eggs, too, and leave them until I come
back,&#8221; explained Mrs. Fabian, graciously.
</p>
<p>Without wasting an extra word or any precious
time, the owner of the rare old candle-sticks
wrapped them in a bit of newspaper and went for
the glass pitcher. Mrs. Fabian had no idea of
the extra item being worth anything, but she included
it, more for fun, than anything else. But
once they saw the tiny glass jug with Sheffield
grape-design on its sides, they all realized that
here was a wonderful &#8220;find.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian seemed uneasy until she had the
paper package in her hand and had paid the
twenty-five cents for the three pieces of glassware.
Then Eleanor made a suggestion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we wait here, Mrs. Fabian, and
look at some of the old china the lady has in this
cupboard, while you go for the lamp. There&#8217;s
no sense in all of us going with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good plan, if Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Nancy
waited for the lady to mention her name.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mrs. Tomlinson,&#8221; said she, politely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mrs. Tomlinson is not too busy to show us
her dear old house,&#8221; added Nancy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, girls. Is that satisfactory?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Fabian. &#8220;How does it appeal to you, Mrs.
Tomlinson?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now that that bread is risin&#8217;, I&#8217;ve got
time to burn,&#8221; declared the lady, independently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. We&#8217;ll visit here while you get the
lamp,&#8221; agreed the girls, deeply concerned to know
where their chaperone would find a lamp such as
Mrs. Tomlinson craved.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian left, and invited the child swinging
on the gate to drive with her as far as Stamford.
The little girl, pleased at the opportunity,
ran for her bonnet and told her ma of the wonderful
invitation.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Tomlinson signified her consent to Sarah&#8217;s
going, and then gave her full attention to showing
her company the house. &#8220;You musn&#8217;t look at
the dirt everywhere, ladies,&#8221; began she, waving
a hand at the immaculate corners and primly-ordered
furniture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now come and see my parlor, girls. I&#8217;m
proud of that room, but we onny use it Sundays,
when Sarah plays the melodian and we sings
hymns. Now an&#8217; then some neighbors come in
evenin&#8217;s, fer a quiltin&#8217;-bee in winter; and I uses it
fer a minister&#8217;s call, but there ain&#8217;t no way to het
the room an&#8217; it&#8217;s all-fired cold fer visitin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly thought of the ranch-house at Pebbly Pit
as Mrs. Tomlinson described the cold winter evenings,
and she smiled at the remembrance of how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
she used to undress in the kitchen beside the roaring
range-fire, and then rush breathlessly into her
cold little room to jump between the blankets and
roll up in them to sleep.
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed outright at the picture of a
visiting dominie sitting on the edge of a chair with
his toes slowly freezing, while his parishioners
tried in quaking tones and with teeth chattering
to entertain him.
</p>
<p>But Mrs. Tomlinson paid no heed to their
laughter, for she was in her glory. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t this
some room?&#8221; demanded she, pulling the shades
up to give enough light to admire the place.
</p>
<p>A stained cherry parlor suite of five pieces upholstered
in cheap satin damask, with a what-not
in one corner, and an easel holding a crayon portrait
of Abe and his bride at the time of their
wedding, in the other corner, graced this best
room. A few cheap chromos flared against the
gorgeous-patterned wall-paper, and a mantel-shelf
was crowded with all sorts of nick-nacks and ornaments.
Polly seemed drawn to this shelf, the
first thing, while the other girls glanced around
the parlor and felt like laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down, a minute?&#8221; invited the
hostess, but her tone suggested fear lest they soil
the damask with their dust-coats.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Polly had made a discovery in that moment she
had to look over the motley collection on the
shelf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a nice tray you have standing against
the wall,&#8221; said she, using Mrs. Fabian&#8217;s tactics to
interest the hostess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s another auction bargain. When
Abe fust got it, the day I went fer that oak side-board,
I got mad. But I&#8217;ve used it a lot sence
then, fer lemonade and cookies, when comp&#8217;ny
comes to visit all afternoon. And I feels made
up, <i>I kin</i> tell you, when I brings that tray in like
all society does.&#8221; Mrs. Tomlinson chuckled to
herself.
</p>
<p>Polly examined the tray and believed it a rare
one. It was oval in shape, and had a stencilled
rim in a conventional design. The coloring was
exquisite, and the central design was a wonderful
basket over-flowing with gorgeous fruit. The
touches of gold on the decorations was the beauty-point
of the unusual object.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted just such a tray, too. I
wonder if you know anyone who has one and will
sell it to me. I&#8217;d drive a long ways to go to an
auction such as you say you attended, when you
bought this tray,&#8221; said Polly, trying to act indifferent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Laws-ee, Miss! I see&#8217;d trays sold at mos&#8217;
every country auction I goes to. I&#8217;d jes&#8217; as soon
sell that one to you, if you like it, but maybe you&#8217;d
think I was askin&#8217; too much if I was to tack on the
cost of time I lost that day. I never got a chanst
to bid on the oak side-board, &#8217;cause a city man
felt so mad at Abe fer buyin&#8217; the tray, that he run
up the side-board out of spite, when he found we
wanted it. Ef he&#8217;d onny a said he wanted the
old tray he&#8217;d cud have had it an&#8217; welcome. But
he never told us. The neighbor who finally got
the side-board laffed an&#8217; told Abe why the man
did the trick. The man told him he&#8217;d double-crossed
us that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly would have offered the woman the full
value of the fine stencilled tray, but Eleanor hurriedly
spoke for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much was the tray with the cost of time
tacked on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t be fair to charge <i>all</i> afternoon,
&#8217;cuz I had a good time with my neighbors what
met at that vendue. But Abe lost three hours&#8217;
work on the corn that day and that is wuth sixty
cents an &#8217;nour, anyway. Tack that on to thirty-five
cents fer the tray, an&#8217; you&#8217;ve got it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Tomlinson started counting laboriously
on her fingers and ultimately reached the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
total as the girls had found five minutes before.
So Polly paid over the munificent sum to the lady&#8217;s
delight, and took possession of the tray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef I onny had some other old things you&#8217;d
like to get, I would almost have enough money
to buy a swell glass lemonade set I saw down to
Stamford one day. It had a glass tray under it
and a dozen painted glasses and a fine glass pitcher&mdash;all
fer two ninety-eight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Almost before the lady had ended her words
of her secret ambition, the four girls had pounced
upon various things found on the shelf. Eleanor
had an old glass toddy-mug with a lid, which was
used for a match-holder in the parlor.
</p>
<p>Nancy selected a small oil lamp with a brass
base and stem, and a lovely-shaped glass shade.
Mrs. Tomlinson informed her it was another auction
bargain that cost fifty cents. Being so expensive
they put it on the parlor mantel instead
of using it.
</p>
<p>Dodo yearned to possess an old afghan she saw
on the settee of the suite of furniture, but she
feared to say so. Finally she summoned courage
enough to offer the lady a price for it that caused
Mrs. Tomlinson a failure about the heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness&#8217; sakes alive! That&#8217;s ten times
more&#8217;n the wool ever cost when the thing was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
<i>new</i>. Take it! Take it, quick, ef you really
mean it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls laughed wildly, for Dodo took it
quickly and paid the price offered to the consternation
of the sales-woman. &#8220;Well,&#8221; gasped she,
at last, &#8220;you must have some family-past what
has to do with knitted covers, is all I can say to
explain you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>By the time the inspection of the house was
over, Mrs. Fabian returned with just such a brass
pedestal banquet lamp as Mrs. Tomlinson had
secretly envied and long hoped for. Such joy and
pleasure as she took in selecting a clean crocheted
mat to spread on the cold marble slab of the
center table, and then place thereon her vision
come true, was worth all the trouble Mrs. Fabian
had had in finding the lamp at a second-hand shop
at Stamford; but later when that wise collector examined
her old candle-sticks and pitcher, she felt
a hundred times repaid for the lamp&mdash;as she truly
was.
</p>
<p>The merry collectors started home that afternoon,
after enjoying the picnic luncheon beside a
brook in the woods back of Stamford, with their
hopes pitched high for future successes in collecting.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken heard from Carl about the successful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
quest that day, and telephoned to the Fabians,
that evening. The Ashbys had hurried over when
they heard of the pieces secured at the farm-house,
and were present when Mr. Dalken questioned
the girls all about their &#8220;find.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re dying to start again, Mr. Dalken,
and hunt up other trophies,&#8221; said Polly, in conclusion.
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A REVOLUTIONARY RELIC HUNT</h3>
</div>

<p>So delighted were the amateur collectors with
the result of their first search for antiques, that
they planned another trip a few days later.
Carl could not drive the car for them, as Mr.
Dalken had invited a number of business friends
who were in New York for a few days to go out
on Long Island with him, for the day. He took
the seven-passenger car and Carl for the drive,
so the girls had to be contented with the smaller
car. But neither Mr. Dalken nor Carl knew
that the girls proposed going alone. They believed
Mr. Fabian or Mr. Ashby&#8217;s chauffeur
would drive the car.
</p>
<p>Eleanor bragged about her ability to drive an
automobile and the girls knew from experience
how well Dodo could drive, so the outing was
planned without any grown-up being consulted
about the driving or chaperoning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did not Carl have a road-map in the side-pocket
of the car, the day he drove us to Stamford?&#8221;
asked Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but the car is in the garage, and the map
with it,&#8221; returned Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy has a road-map. I&#8217;ll get his,&#8221; remarked
Ruth Ashby, who had been invited to be
one of the party this trip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then bring it around tonight, Ruth, when you
come to plan about the route we ought to choose
for this outing,&#8221; said Polly.
</p>
<p>Ruth hurried home and immediately after dinner,
that evening, she found the map in the library
desk-drawer and tucked it in her pocket.
As she ran through the front hall she called to
her mother:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to the Fabians for a little talk,
Mummy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Ruth, you just came from there a few
moments before dinner,&#8221; came from Mrs. Ashby.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t visit that time! I only stopped
in with the girls to wait and see if Nancy had a
map they all need. Now I&#8217;m going to visit,&#8221; explained
Ruth.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Ashby laughed at a girl&#8217;s interpretations
of a call and Ruth ran out.
</p>
<p>Their pretty heads were closely bending over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
the map, when Mr. Fabian passed the living-room
door and stopped a moment to consider the picture
they made under the soft-shaded light. He
went on to his private den without saying a word
to distract their attention from (as he thought)
their books of learning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now listen here, girls!&#8221; exclaimed Nancy,
tracing a line on the map. &#8220;Polly doesn&#8217;t know
much about this end of the United States, and
Eleanor doesn&#8217;t know much more than Polly does
but I am supposed to be well informed about
Westchester County, having lived there when I
was a little girl. So I can tell you something
about this road I&#8217;ve traced.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The four girls lifted their heads and listened
eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know Dobb&#8217;s Ferry and its vicinity was
there in the days of the Revolution, and Washington
camped at that town. Even the Headquarters
he occupied is to be seen as it was at that
time. This road, running easterly from Dobb&#8217;s
Ferry, is the old turnpike road used by the army
as it marched towards the Hudson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now this is what I say! Why shouldn&#8217;t
there be lots of old houses along that road, or in
that locality, that were there during Washington&#8217;s
time? And if standing still, why shouldn&#8217;t there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
be old furniture, or odd bits, to be found in
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor instantly caught Nancy up on one of
her phrases. &#8220;Naturally the houses would be
standing still&mdash;you wouldn&#8217;t want them to be dancing
a tango, would you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, Nolla!&#8221; scorned Nancy, in disgust
at such a poor attempt to joke, &#8220;you know,
well enough, what I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other girls laughed at Nancy, and Polly
added: &#8220;Well, what is your plan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, let&#8217;s drive along the River Road as far
as Dobb&#8217;s Ferry, and then turn off to this road
and venture on any country road we find, that has
old-fashioned houses which look as if they were
built in 1776.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds thrilling!&#8221; laughed Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Her companions refused to smile this time, so
she sat grinning at Nancy, as if waiting to attack
her again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that plan will answer as well as anything
Nolla has proposed, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked
Nancy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll try your scheme out, Nan. But
you&#8217;ll have to be the guide through the country,
as we haven&#8217;t the least idea of the lay of the land,&#8221;
said Dodo.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll succeed splendidly, as long as we have
this map,&#8221; promised Nancy.
</p>
<p>The girls pictured many rare treasures added
to their collection after this proposed trip, and
when it was time for Ruth to go home, each girl
had chosen rare and wonderful objects to be
found in these imaginary Colonial home-steads
they expected to visit on the morrow.
</p>
<p>Classes had to be attended to before excursions
could be enjoyed and then it was lunch-time; but
after that they finally started on this trip.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian was out with Mrs. Ashby, so the
girls met no one who would question them, when
they were ready to leave. Ruth and Dodo called
at the Fabians and they all went to the large garage
where Mr. Dalken kept his automobiles;
and the man, having had instructions to give the
car to these young friends of the owner, whenever
they wanted it, said nothing but backed the car
out to the street for them.
</p>
<p>The five girls drove away in high spirits, for
they were eager to harvest all the marvelous antiques
they had ever read or heard of, that might
be scattered throughout the country-sides wherever
General Washington had made a camp for
his army.
</p>
<p>Dodo was an excellent driver but she had no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
New York license, and the girls had forgotten all
about that necessity. So the car was speeding
along the boulevarde at about twenty-five miles
an hour, when a traffic policeman in Yonkers held
up his hand to stop the northward-bound
travelers.
</p>
<p>Dodo had just turned her head momentarily
to send a quizzical look at Polly who sat in the
back seat, and so failed to see the raised hand.
The car therefore ran across the street and at the
same time, a low-built racer shot along the right
of way and the two noses rammed each other, although
both drivers used the emergency brakes.
</p>
<p>The girls screamed with fright at the unexpected
shock and the dreadful jolt they received
when the cars collided. And two young college
students cursed politely and scowled fearfully at
the &#8220;crazy girl-drivers&#8221; who never knew which
way they were going. But the poor cars suffered
the most from this conflict. Headlights were
smashed, fenders and mud guards were so dented
in as to look pitiful, while the front wheels of
both cars were interlocked in such a way that
they could not be separated.
</p>
<p>This cause held up all traffic on both streets
and annoyed the officer so that he threatened a
wholesale arrest. He asked the names of both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
drivers. The young man gave his as &#8220;John Baxter,
New York.&#8221; His license number was taken,
and he was asked for his permit. He showed it
without hesitation, and the girls gazed at each
other in dismay. They had forgotten about such
a need!
</p>
<p>The officer came over to Dodo&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dodo Alexander,&#8221; stammered she, forgetting
her full name.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Baptized that name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;no, oh NO. I never was baptized, I
reckon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph&mdash;a heathen, I see!&#8221; snarled the policeman.
&#8220;Well, where do you live, or where&#8217;d
you hail from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor had been grinning at the officer&#8217;s reply,
and now she could not withstand the temptation
to answer: &#8220;From the Cannibal Isles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The crowd standing about the two cars,
laughed&mdash;all but the policeman. He scowled at
Eleanor and said: &#8220;Be careful, young lady, or
I&#8217;ll take you along for contempt of court.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not arresting <i>me</i>, and this is not
Court,&#8221; argued Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, goodness me! Is he going to arrest me?&#8221;
cried Dodo.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t answer my questions promptly,
I&#8217;ll arrest you,&#8221; returned the officer, severely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am from Denver, Colorado, where
folks don&#8217;t fuss like you do in the East, just because
you cross a street to get to the other side!&#8221;
declared Dodo, in self-justification.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From Denver! Got a New York license to
drive?&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ve driven all over England
and the Continent this Summer&mdash;as these
girls will tell you. They were in the party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing to me whether you drove up the
Matterhorn and down the other side; as long as
you can&#8217;t show me a plain old American license,
you&#8217;ll have to pay the costs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much is it?&#8221; quickly asked Dodo, taking
her purse out to settle the bill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. You&#8217;d better follow me to the
police station and we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dodo was handed a little paper which she read
aloud to her horrified companions, and thus, finding
themselves arrested, they meekly tried to follow
the blue-jacket. But the cars had not been
disentangled, although both boys from the racer
were doing their utmost to clear the way.
</p>
<p>As the storm raised in the hearts of the two
students by the carelessness of Dodo abated, both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
boys realized how pretty and helpless the five girls
were, so they began to feel sorry for them. Besides
this, the front wheels were now divorced
and the two cars backed away from each other to
give room for the congested traffic to pass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; wailed Dodo, &#8220;what will Mr.
Dalken say when he hears about his car! I don&#8217;t
mind going to jail or being made to pay a hundred
dollars fine, but to break up his automobile the
first time I drove it, and get his license tag into
trouble&mdash;that is terrible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly laughed. &#8220;Not Dalken&#8217;s license tag,
but his name&mdash;in the papers. That&#8217;s what comes
of being so well-known in New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the newspaper men will be sure to say
that a party of joy-riders stole his car to have a
little jaunt in the country, I suppose,&#8221; added
Eleanor, teasingly.
</p>
<p>One of the good-looking young students now
came over to the girls and lifted his cap. &#8220;Did
I understand you to say this is Mr. Dalken&#8217;s
car?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Five girls glowered at him. Polly snapped
out: &#8220;Are you a reporter from a city paper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>John Baxter laughed. &#8220;No, I am his protegé.
Mr. Dalken is the executor of my father&#8217;s estate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and I was just on my way to the city, to visit him,
this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh how nice! We know Mr. Dalken very
well, too. He is one of our best friends,&#8221; returned
Polly, eagerly.
</p>
<p>Nancy Fabian would have been more reticent
had she been spokeswoman for the girls; but both
boys were so pleasant, now, that they were introducing
themselves to the girls, hence she said
nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go with you to the station house and see
that the sergeant behaves himself,&#8221; suggested
John.
</p>
<p>The girls felt very grateful to this needed
friend, and the boys started their car after the
policeman, the girls following in their damaged
car that bumped and jolted on one side.
</p>
<p>When the inspector learned that not one of the
five girls had a license to drive a car in New York
State, and that the car belonged to someone else,
he fined Dodo and gave her a good scolding to
boot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This time I&#8217;ll let you off easy, as you are
green in the East. But don&#8217;t let it happen again,
or you&#8217;ll be sorry. Apply for a permit to drive,
as soon as you get home, young lady, and then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
get a book of rules on traffic, and learn it by
heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dodo meekly paid the fine, and the young people
left the room with lighter hearts than they
had entered it. Both cars had to be taken to a
garage and put into running shape again. Meantime
there would be two hours of waiting on their
hands, and seven young folks with impatient blood
in their veins to kill that time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you ladies have been deprived of
your pleasure drive, but I might suggest a little
consolation if you ever deign to go to the Movies,&#8221;
said John Baxter, politely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good show up the street in that
large Picture Theatre,&#8221; added his friend Andrews.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We love movies&mdash;when they are good,&#8221; ventured
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think, Nan? Shall we go?&#8221;
asked Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes! it will be awful&mdash;waiting about this
place with nowhere to go other than the Movies,
as you say,&#8221; returned Nancy.
</p>
<p>So the two young men escorted the five girls
to the show where they forgot their recent troubles
in watching Harold Lloyd do his best to break
his neck.
</p>
<p>Dodo paid the bill at the garage for both cars,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
even though the boys insisted that they pay for
their own damages. But she replied: &#8220;No, the
insurance company will have to settle eventually.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The good-natured way in which Dodo accepted
the situation more than convinced the boys that
these girls were &#8220;bricks&#8221; all right! It was now
past five, and the cars were ready to go again, but
the &#8220;collectors&#8221; found they had to go back to the
city for that time, without having seen as much
as a shadow of an antique.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you girls do about getting home?&#8221;
asked Andrews.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, drive, of course!&#8221; returned Dodo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t&mdash;you haven&#8217;t a license. Neither
has any one of the other girls,&#8221; explained Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we never thought of that!&#8221; exclaimed
Polly, perplexed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have one,&#8221; suggested Andrews. &#8220;I can get
in your car, and one of you girls can drive with
Baxter, if you will. That will solve the problem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Dodo, getting out of her
seat to allow Andrews to get in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one wants to drive with Jack?&#8221; asked
Andrews.
</p>
<p>Neither girl answered, and not as much as by
a tremor of the eye-lid did either show how delighted
she would have been to sit beside the handsome
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
young man and skim along the road to New
York.
</p>
<p>Baxter laughed heartily, and Andrews added:
&#8220;I never dreamed that <i>no</i> one would care to drive
with him. I&#8217;m sorry, Jack, but you&#8217;ll have to
go alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I know it!&#8221; retorted Baxter, quickly.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t choose when all are so desirable, but we
can cast lots to see who will be my companion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls thought this most exciting, and when
Andrews had shown the slip of paper that would
be the lucky draw, and then had folded and shaken
the slips well in his cap, the girls drew. As each
girl opened her scrap of paper to find it was
blank, and then watched the others try, there was
great laughter and anxious waiting. Finally
Polly opened her slip and found she had drawn
the lucky one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! Isn&#8217;t Jack Baxter lucky, though!&#8221;
laughed Eleanor. &#8220;Not only gets the cleverest
girl in the crowd, but the prettiest one, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop your nonsense, Nolla! How many
times do I have to tell you to allow me to live in
peace, without so much of your chaffing!&#8221; exclaimed
Polly, impatiently.
</p>
<p>Everyone laughed merrily at Polly&#8217;s retort, and
Baxter looked admiringly at the flushed cheeks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
and sparkling eyes. He was most gallant in assisting
Polly into the &#8220;boat&#8221; as he called it, and
then he jumped in beside her.
</p>
<p>Eleanor sat beside Andrews in the other car,
and entertained him with a highly colored story
of Polly and her home in Pebbly Pit. Before
they reached the Fabian home in New York,
young Andrews pictured the enormous wealth of
&#8220;Choko&#8217;s Find&#8221; gold mine, and the marvellous
beauty of the lava jewels found in Rainbow Cliffs
on the ranch. To think that one girl should be
lucky enough to own both such money-producers!
</p>
<p>Shortly after dinner that evening, Mr. Dalken
telephoned the girls and told them to come over
to his apartment for a party. He explained that
he had two nice little boys visiting him, and he
was at a loss to know how to entertain them so
that they would care to come again, another day.
Remembering how well Polly and her friends
managed other boys, he felt sure that they could
help him now.
</p>
<p>Polly laughed in reply, and said: &#8220;Oh yes!
If one of those boys now visiting you, is anything
like Jack Baxter who drove me home, this afternoon,
we won&#8217;t have any trouble in amusing
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Polly never told Mr. Dalken that Jack
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
declared himself so deeply in love with her, before
she had been in his car ten minutes, that she had
all she could do to keep him at the wheel instead
of placing an arm about her, and thus stalling the
engine in the ditch alongside the main road to the
city.
</p>
<p>That evening, after the girls returned from Mr.
Dalken&#8217;s party, Eleanor remarked: &#8220;My goodness!
Polly has another scalp to hang to her belt
of trophies. If she keeps on piercing hearts, as
she has done this past year, she&#8217;ll have to discard
some of her old scalps and loan them to us, to
make room for her new ones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Polly sniffed loftily at such foolishness, and
made no reply.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT COLLECTING</h3>
</div>

<p>Although the trip planned for the Dobb&#8217;s
Ferry territory had ended so disastrously, the
girls were not discouraged. Dodo secured a license
without any difficulty, and was equipped to
drive Mr. Dalken&#8217;s car without being fined a second
time. But the wise owner of the car considered
it wiser to send Carl out on these excursions,
instead of trusting to Fate to bring the
girls back home again without broken bones or a
damage suit.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fabian had had a brilliant idea, too, after
he heard his wife&#8217;s story of the country auction
where the old antiques had been secured by Mrs.
Tomlinson. He suggested that they subscribe to
several country papers, both daily and weekly,
and in that way they would learn of any vendue
advertised in its columns.
</p>
<p>Eagerly following his advice, the four girls&mdash;Nancy
was not interested in antiques but was willing
to go around with her friends when they hunted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
for them&mdash;subscribed for the Yonkers papers,
the White Plains papers, several weeklies in New
Jersey, and others, in order to learn of any country
auctions advertised for the following week.
</p>
<p>Through this medium, they read of a country
sale advertised for the following Thursday, to
take place at an old farm home-stead way back
in the hills of Westchester. The items mentioned
included a mahogany four-poster bed, and
other old bits.
</p>
<p>Polly and Eleanor had not attended an auction
since the days in Paris, and neither of them had
ever heard of, or witnessed a back-farm country auction,
so they were not prepared for what they
really experienced.
</p>
<p>Carl was detailed to drive them, that day, and
Mrs. Fabian escorted them, in the seven-passenger
car. They took the turnpike road as far as
White Plains and then turned to the left to follow
a country road that would lead past the farm.
</p>
<p>The sale was advertised for eleven o&#8217;clock, but
the girls did not arrive on the premises until
twelve. Still no auctioneer was to be seen or
heard. Groups of farmers stood around, gossiping
about their crops that season, and their wives
sat indoors exchanging notes on canning, new
neighbors, or babies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>Polly gazed curiously at the types assembled
for that sale, and whispered to Eleanor:
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you say these farmers had been picked
up from Oak Creek ranches and dropped down
here in this front door-yard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor smiled and nodded. Then she said
in a low voice: &#8220;They don&#8217;t look as if they were
here to buy. We seem to be the only folks here
with a pocket-book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A young farmer who had been leaning against
the old well now came forward to welcome the
strangers who stood looking about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I be the clerk fer the auctionair, but he hain&#8217;t
come, yit. His baby swallered a shet safety-pin
an&#8217; they had an orful time wid ippycak tryin&#8217; to
git it that way. Now the doctor&#8217;s thar sayin&#8217;
that stuff is all wrong. He&#8217;ll git the pin, all
right, &#8217;cause I swallered a quarter, onct, and he
got it, but it costed me a hull dollar extra to pay
him fer his docterin&#8217;. Ye&#8217;s kin go in and peer
aroun&#8217; to see ef you wants anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian expressed her sympathy for the
parents of the baby and said she knew just how
frightened the mother must be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; was the clerk&#8217;s astonishing reply.
&#8220;She&#8217;s young Kit Morehouse what ain&#8217;t got a
grain of sense in her bean. This baby&#8217;s mother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
died when it was a week old, and Lem had to have
someone look affer it. Thar warn&#8217;t no sensible
woman about what would hev him, &#8217;cause he don&#8217;t
make salt fer a red herrin&#8217;, seein&#8217; his professhun
is auctionin&#8217; an&#8217; folks ain&#8217;t sellin&#8217; out like-as-much
as they ust to be, years ago. But this crazy Kit
was onny nineteen, with no fam&#8217;ly, er no payin&#8217;
job, so she hired out to take keer of the kid.
Don&#8217;t it allus end like this? The gal marries
the father an&#8217; gets mad cause another woman&#8217;s
kid is cryin&#8217; around!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls were intensely interested in this bit
of local gossip, but Mrs. Fabian thought they had
heard enough about &#8220;Kit,&#8221; so she bid the clerk
good-by and started for the low one-story-and-a-half
house.
</p>
<p>The interior presented a different appearance
from the home of Mrs. Tomlinson&#8217;s. Every conceivable
object ever used in the house was brought
out and placed in the front rooms. Women and
children sat about on various sorts of seats, waiting
for the sale to begin. As most of the assembly
were neighbors and acquainted with each other,
the entrance of Mrs. Fabian and her girls caused
quite a surprise.
</p>
<p>Audible whispers of &#8220;Who air they?&#8221; and
&#8220;Where did they come from?&#8221; or &#8220;What d&#8217;ye
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
s&#8217;pose they come to bid on?&#8221; were heard on all
sides as the strangers passed through the &#8220;settin&#8217;
room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The moment Mrs. Fabian&#8217;s party left the clerk,
outside, he hurried over to the automobile where
Carl sat enjoying a quiet smoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Howde,&#8221; began Abner Clark, the clerk.
</p>
<p>Carl removed his pipe and nodded nonchalantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you-all hail from about these parts?&#8221; asked
Abner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say <i>not</i>!&#8221; declared Carl, emphatically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From whar abouts are you?&#8221; continued the
clerk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;New York City&mdash;and that&#8217;s some town, let
me tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeh&mdash;so I&#8217;ve heran say. How did yeh get
to come here to this vendue?&#8221; persisted Abner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t know&mdash;I&#8217;m only the chauffeur. Why
don&#8217;t you ask the ladies if you are so anxious to
know?&#8221; Carl was growing angry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;no harm meant,&#8221; replied Abner,
soothingly, as he turned away.
</p>
<p>Carl resumed his pipe, and Abner strolled over
to the group of men sitting on wheel-barrows,
ploughs, chicken-coops, etc. With a furtive look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
over his shoulder, to make sure the city driver
was not listening, Abner began to explain to his
interested friends who the strangers were.
</p>
<p>But he had not quite ended his tale before an
old buggy drove up and the auctioneer got out.
He glanced over the assembled farmers with an
appraising eye, and then carefully hitched the old
nag to a tree. This done, he broke off a great
chunk of tobacco from a cake kept in a blue paper,
and popped it into his mouth.
</p>
<p>Abner walked over to the white-washed fence
to greet his superior. &#8220;How&#8217;s the kid?&#8221; were
his first words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, now. He diden&#8217; swaller the pin,
after all. The doctor found it down inside his
shirt, an&#8217; it cost me a dollar besides all that good
mustard and eppicac, fer nuthin&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; sympathized Abner, not knowing
what would be best to say in such a delicate
case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did yuh keep all the folks about when I sent
word over?&#8221; continued the auctioneer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shure! An&#8217; we&#8217;ve got some swell city buyers,
this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;City! You don&#8217;t mean anyone from the city&#8217;d
want to buy old Morrisey&#8217;s trash?&#8221; exclaimed
Lemuel, in disbelief.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno what they want, but thar&#8217;s their man
what steers the autermobile,&#8221; and Abner directed
a thumb over his left shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, wall! Come along; we&#8217;ll hurry up to
get some of their coin afore they git tired
awaitin&#8217;!&#8221; declared the wise man, as he made
haste to reach the house.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian and the girls had made a cursory
visit to the rooms on the ground floor, and while
they stood in the small kitchen examining various
old dishes and glassware in the cupboard, Polly
spied a very narrow staircase leading to the attic.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going up to see if there&#8217;s anything up
there,&#8221; said she. So without another word, she
ran up the creaky steps.
</p>
<p>The girls heard her walking overhead, and then
heard her pull a heavy object across the floor.
In another minute she came racing down the steps
at a break-neck speed, her face all streaked with
dirt and her dress covered with cob-webs and the
dust of ages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, folks! Do come up and see what I found
in an old box under the eaves!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They needed no second invitation, and soon all
were up beside the box. There were many other
empty boxes standing about and in some way this
particular box had escaped the attention of Abner,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
who had taken the inventory of the contents of
the house and barns.
</p>
<p>Polly had removed the first object on top of
the box which was an old woven coverlet in rare
colorings of blue and white. In one corner was
the name of the weaver and the date it was completed.
Polly was not aware that old woven coverlets
were considered very desirable by collectors,
but she had read the date which showed the spread
was more than a hundred years old, so she judged
it was worth bidding on at the coming sale.
</p>
<p>Directly under this woven coverlet was a white
spread. It was very old and torn at the corners,
but the rest of it was in good condition. Mrs.
Fabian saw at once that it was a spread of the
finest candle-wicking style she had ever seen. It
must have dated back to the early part of the
eighteenth century.
</p>
<p>Under this white bed-spread were small bundles
of hand-spun linen towels, yellow with age but in
perfect condition as to wear. But the greatest
find of all, in this box, were the old brasses in
the bottom.
</p>
<p>Wrapped in papers to keep them clean, Polly
found a long-handled warming-pan; a set of fire-irons&mdash;the
tongs, shovel, and andirons of the famous
&#8220;acorn-top&#8221; design; and a funny old foot-warmer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
A pair of ancient bellows was the last
article found in the box, but the leather was so
dry and old that pieces fell out when Polly tried to
make the bellows work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go right down and tell that clerk about
these wonderful things. They must have overlooked
them when they listed all the other articles
in the house,&#8221; said Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>Eleanor held her back and said: &#8220;You&#8217;d better
not tell him the news in that excited manner.
He&#8217;ll understand at once, that these things are desirable,
and then we&#8217;ll have to pay well for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Nolla!&#8221; laughed Nancy, and
her mother admitted as much.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we just take them down to the
kitchen and pile them on the table. No one will
know that we want them, and should anyone ask
what we were doing up here and by what right we
carried them down from the attic, we can honestly
say that Abner said we could go over the house
and see if there was anything we liked to buy,&#8221;
said Polly, with a collector&#8217;s instinct for not paying
extortionate prices for what she wanted.
</p>
<p>The girls laughed, but each one caught up some
object, and having gathered all safely in their
arms, they started down. The kitchen, being the
least desirable room to visit in the farmer&#8217;s wife&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
judgment, no one was there when Mrs. Fabian
and the girls returned to it. Their discoveries
were piled on the old drop-leaf table, and they
grouped themselves at the doorways to keep
guard over the prizes.
</p>
<p>A loud voice was shouting at the open front
door, saying: &#8220;This are the terms of the sale:
Everything bid on &#8217;s got to be paid fer the same
day and removed from the premises in twenty-four
hours&mdash;all but th&#8217; barn-stock. You&#8217;se kin
take forty-eight hours fer them. I expecks everyone
to pay cash fer anything they buy, &#8217;cause I
got enough trouble at that last sale at Hubbells&#8217;
when a lot of you folks bid on stuff an&#8217; then went
home an&#8217; left it on my hands. Hubbell&#8217;s son had
to give &#8217;em away at last, and I lost all that commission.
So, none of that, at this vendue!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Some of the assembled people looked guilty,
and the auctioneer rode rough-shod over their
feelings. &#8220;Anudder thing: Don&#8217;t haggle on a
cent! When I call out a decent bid on a thing,
raise it a nickel, at least, if you wants it. This
cent business&mdash;and at Hubbell&#8217;s vendue, some of
you&#8217;se even bid half a cent at a time&mdash;makes me
tired! If a thing ain&#8217;t wuth a cent more to yeh,
then let it go to the other feller what wants it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls laughed at this frank statement of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
<i>sense</i>, and Lemuel turned to see who had appreciated
his speech. When he saw the city people
Abner had mentioned, he felt warmed all through,
for he felt sure he would earn some commissions
that day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first number is in th&#8217; kitchen. Ab, kin
we get in thar, er had we better hold the stuff
out here?&#8221; asked Lemuel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hold up the kitchen stove, kin I?&#8221; asked
Abner, in an injured tone.
</p>
<p>The people laughed heartily, Mrs. Fabian&#8217;s
party joining more appreciatively than anyone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered the auctioneer, in a matter-of-fact
voice. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try to crowd in. But
don&#8217;t anyone what don&#8217;t want to bid on kitchen
stuff, come and use the room from others!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed that his very warning acted contrariwise
for, to the girls, it looked as if everyone on
the premises tried to crowd into that small room.
Being first on the ground, they fared best for
place. Mrs. Fabian mounted the steps leading to
the attic and advised the girls to get up on the
table, chairs, or other solid objects, to be able to
look over the heads of the crowd.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Ab, what you got first?&#8221; asked the auctioneer.
</p>
<p>Abner had his little book of items, and finding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
the table the first number inventoried, he called
out: &#8220;Deal table and contents!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now Polly stood on the table, and all the covers
had been thrown upon it, also, so when Abner
shouted out &#8220;table and contents&#8221; Lemuel laughed
loudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, one of them contents is a mighty pooty
gal, I kin tell yuh! I&#8217;ll begin bidding myself, on
such a bargain!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The country-folks laughed wildly at such a fine
joke, and Polly, eager to own the other valuable
contents, smiled with them and nodded her head
at the salesman. He was not aware that she
meant she would bid, for his customers always
shouted forth their bids. Then a man asked:
&#8220;What sort of contents is thar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Abner pushed his way through the crowd to
open the drawer in the table and enumerate the
small ware mentioned as &#8220;contents,&#8221; when he
saw, to his surprise, that there was a heap of covers
on the table.
</p>
<p>He picked them up and stared at them in dumbfounded
amazement, then said: &#8220;Say, Lem,
here&#8217;s them old bed-quilts we had sech a job
huntin&#8217; up. Whar the heck&#8217;d they come from,
I&#8217;m sure I dunno!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You got &#8217;em, eh? Well, they ain&#8217;t listed, so
sell &#8217;em fust. I&#8217;ll mark them an &#8216;A&#8217; lot. Who
wants to bid on a ole bed-spread?&#8221; called Lemuel.
</p>
<p>Had the women-folk known of bedding to be
sold in the kitchen, there would have been a mad
rush for it. But most of them were waiting for
the blankets and comfortables found in the two
small bed-rooms annexed to the parlor. So but
few were in the kitchen when the old candle-wicking
spread was bid on by Polly, and knocked down
to her for a dollar-ninety.
</p>
<p>Eleanor got the blue and white woven coverlet
for a dollar and a half, and Mrs. Fabian bought
the linen towels &#8220;in a lot&#8221; for two dollars. The
old brasses that were also listed as an &#8220;A&#8221; lot
were knocked down as follows: Polly bought
the ancient foot-warmer for sixty cents; Eleanor
secured the warming-pan for a dollar, and Dodo,
the set of fire-irons with acorn tops, for three
dollars. These undreamed-of bargains elated the
girls so that they lost all discretion for a time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we&#8217;ve cleared them things out of
our way, we&#8217;ll sell the table,&#8221; said Lemuel, and
forthwith he gave the table to a farmer for fifty
cents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What &#8217;che got next, Ab?&#8221; asked he.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some kitchen dishes,&#8221; replied Abner, as he
opened the cupboard and displayed several samples
of blue ware.
</p>
<p>Eleanor saw the familiar pattern of the pagodas
and willows that are found on old willow-ware,
and instantly decided that these must be
rare antiques because they were found in the same
house as the ancient objects just acquired by her
and her friends. So she raised the first bid of
ten cents for eight odd pieces, to a dollar.
</p>
<p>The auctioneer gasped. He gazed at Eleanor
and said faintly: &#8220;Did you bid a dollar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Miss, you kin have them, but pay
me now fer them, and don&#8217;t come back naggin&#8217;
me to say I stuck you wid cracked plates, and
nicked saucers. You saw&#8217;d them afore you bid!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed, and handed over a dollar bill,
but Mrs. Fabian tried to catch her eye to warn
her not to bid recklessly on other things. Polly
stood up on the table wondering why Eleanor got
the old kitchen dishes.
</p>
<p>The moment Lemuel had the dollar safely in
his pocket, he remarked: &#8220;Gee! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; out
of this second-hand sellin&#8217; and lay in a stock of
ten-cent blue dishes to sell!&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the farmers haw-hawed and said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
&#8220;That&#8217;s how Coolworth made so much money!
Gettin&#8217; so much cheap stuff and findin&#8217; a pack of
silly women to buy &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor tossed her head, but had she kept quiet
she would not have been the object of pity she
found herself, afterward. In self-justification of
her purchase, she called out: &#8220;You people don&#8217;t
know genuine old Wedgewood when you see it.
I&#8217;ve got a big bargain in those eight plates!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that statement, a quiet young fellow, who
had been standing about watching progress and
noting the bids on a paper, laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want anyone to say they was taken in at my folk&#8217;s
sale; but I got&#8217;ta tell that young lady that I bought
them blue dishes <i>myself</i>, last year, at the tea-store
in White Plains fer ten cents each.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even Polly had to join in the laugh at Eleanor&#8217;s
expense now, and poor Nolla felt like selling herself
for a nickel. But the auctioneer had scant
time for jokes or reckless buyers as he was there
for business. So he finished the kitchen and
called them into the parlor. Here Polly secured
a china dog such as were common sixty to eighty
years ago; Eleanor got a real bargain, this time,
in buying two century old flower-vases for fifty
cents. Mrs. Fabian saw an old engraving of
&#8220;Washington Crossing the Delaware,&#8221; as it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
taken from the wall behind the door, and offered
for a quarter. On the spur of the moment she
raised the bid five cents and got the picture which
later proved to be one of the rare old originals,
worth several hundred dollars.
</p>
<p>Dodo ran up a pair of girandoles that stood on
the narrow mantel-shelf in the front room, and
finally got them for three dollars. Such an unheard-of
price made the buyers look at her in
pity, and Lemuel remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, some folks has more money than sense!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dodo&#8217;s friends laughed heartily at this criticism,
but she cared little for them all, because
she knew what she had obtained for her money.
</p>
<p>The two bed-rooms were so small that few people
could get in, so the auctioneer ordered Abner
to carry the articles for sale, out on the lawn
where everyone could see them. Had it not been
for this sensible advice, Polly would never have
seen or secured the fine old set of Staffordshire
toilet-ware that was knocked down to her for four
dollars.
</p>
<p>It consisted of ewer in quaint shape, basin deep
enough to be a huge punch-bowl, a soap-plate, a
mug, and a commode. The rich deep coloring of
the design on the china was lovely, and every piece
was in good order.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>The young man who had told the truth about
the eight dishes from the tea-store, congratulated
Polly and said: &#8220;That set has been in our family
for more&#8217;n a hundred years. My grandmother
used to keep it fer show, er when we had
fine comp&#8217;ny comin&#8217; to see us. That&#8217;s how it
kept so good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t you want to keep it, then?&#8221; asked
Polly, regretfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; west on the money I git outen
this sale, an&#8217; I&#8217;d ruther see someone what likes it
own it, than any old clod-hopper about these
parts!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly felt sure the owner had not been lovingly
treated by the people he glanced at as he spoke.
But she learned, just before leaving the place that
afternoon, that he felt so antagonistic against his
neighbors because of their frank criticism of his
habit of spending his inheritance.
</p>
<p>Because of this unwise recklessness, he had had
to mortgage the old farm, and when the proceeds
of that had been spent, he had to sell out. &#8220;Perhaps
his going west, where he would have to work
hard for his living, would be his salvation, after
this,&#8221; thought Polly.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian allowed the girls to watch the sale
until the contents of the house were sold out and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
then she suggested that they start back home.
The bargains were carefully placed between the
coverlets purchased, and then the buyers got in
the car.
</p>
<p>The country-people were all crowding to the
barns to bid on stock and farm-utensils when Carl
started the engine. With a last look at the little
house where they had found their interesting antiques,
the collectors left.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>POLLY&#8217;S HUNT IN &#8217;JERSEY</h3>
</div>

<p>The collectors took several long trips, after
the vendue in Westchester County, but found
nothing of value at any place.
</p>
<p>Still they lived in hopes, and towards the last
of October, Polly suggested that they try New
Jersey for a change. A girl who attended Art
Classes told Polly of several very old places
within the vicinity of Springfield and Morristown&mdash;both
old Revolutionary towns of historic fame.
</p>
<p>So Carl drove up to the Fabian home early one
Saturday morning, and Mrs. Fabian with her
party, hurried out with luncheon and wraps, and
were soon speeding away for the ferry-boat that
would take them across the North River.
</p>
<p>The girls had never been in New Jersey, and
found much to admire in the picturesque, rolling
land of the Jersey Hills. They left Newark behind,
and drove along the Union Turnpike road
until they reached the Forks. Here they turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
to the left and in a short time, were going through
the ancient town of Springfield.
</p>
<p>They were already past it, before Mrs. Fabian
found what place it was. Then they laughed,
and turned back again to visit a shop on the main
street. Mrs. Fabian got out of the car and went
in to question the proprietor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know of any old houses, near here,
where one can secure old bits of furniture, or antique
objects?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man chuckled. &#8220;Say, Madam, if I have
one person ask me that same question, I have
dozens stop to question me. I tells them all, the
same as I tells you now&mdash;the only antique I can
send them to anywhere about Springfield, is that
old church on the corner, where you can see the
hole blown in the side by a cannon ball, when the
British were here. And over yonder, you will
find a burial ground where many old Indians are
buried, with their stone arrow-heads and other
trophies with them. The crumbling grey-stone
slabs and the ancient tombs found there, will give
you the dates. Some go as far back as two hundred,
or two hundred and fifty years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian thanked him and returned to the
girls to repeat the conversation she had had with
the shop-keeper. They all declared for a visit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
to the old church, and then to the cemetery, so
Carl drove back and they visited both places.
</p>
<p>In the ancient burial ground, they read many
queer epitaphs on the head stones, and some of
these the girls copied down. Then they got back
in the automobile and Carl was told to drive on
to Morristown.
</p>
<p>This place was found to be so dreadfully modern,
that no hope of discovering antiques was left
alive in their hearts. But it was noon and they
were hungry, so they discussed the advisability of
going to a lunch-room, or driving into the country
and having the picnic lunch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as we brought such a nice luncheon
with us, why stop at a hotel or restaurant to eat?&#8221;
asked Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There really isn&#8217;t any sense in doing that, but
there certainly isn&#8217;t any picnic place in this town,&#8221;
declared Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then let&#8217;s start out and find one away
from here,&#8221; suggested Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make another proposition, girls,&#8221; said
Mrs. Fabian. &#8220;Why not stop at that Public Library
we just passed, and find out if there are
any notable spots in the vicinity of this town,
where we might find old houses or old objects?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the idea is good, but really, Mrs. Fabian,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
this town impresses me most emphatically
with this fact: that the residents have as much
desire for antiques as we have; and most likely,
they started in years before we ever were born,
to rake over the country-side, which must have
been rich with old furniture and other things
from Washington&#8217;s days here, so as to collect all
those things for themselves,&#8221; was Dodo&#8217;s sensible
remark.
</p>
<p>The others smiled at her practical words, and
Mrs. Fabian agreed with her. &#8220;But it will do
no harm to stop just a moment to ask the attendant
at the Library if she knows of any place in
New Jersey where we might indulge our craze
of collecting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Carl then turned around and they were soon
back at the Library. The girls remained in the
car while Mrs. Fabian went indoors to ask questions
of the agreeable lady at the desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you will find a few old bits, here and
there, about the country-side,&#8221; said the lady, in
reply to Mrs. Fabian&#8217;s questions. &#8220;In fact, my
friend furnished her old-fashioned house that she
recently bought of an old 1776 family, by driving
about through the Mendham country, down
through New Vernon and Baskingridge&mdash;all famous
Revolutionary places, you know&mdash;and by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
visiting places as far away as Bound Brook, Plainfield,
and the country about Trenton. I was
amazed at the number of old things she managed
to secure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Being given a pencil sketch of what roads to
follow to reach Mendham, or Baskingridge, Mrs.
Fabian thanked her informer most graciously.
Suddenly the lady said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you are in town, why not drive down
to a little auction room I&#8217;ve heard of, just off
Washington Street, and see if you can find anything
in that Paradise for old stuff?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will! Where is it, and how do we get
there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man&#8217;s name is Van Styne, and he used to
be a magnet for attracting the oldest pieces to
his store-rooms! People used to commission
him when they wanted anything in particular, and
in some super-natural manner, he used to have it
for them in a few days&#8217; time. It would have
taken ordinary individuals years, with plenty of
money and energy, to accomplish the same result.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Fabian thanked her interested informer,
and left the library. The girls were told
of the conversation and they all voted to go to
Van Styne&#8217;s old auction rooms first, and then try
to locate an old farm-house along the road to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Mendham, or in the opposite direction, towards
Baskingridge.
</p>
<p>The building where &#8220;Van Styne&mdash;Auctioneer
and Appraiser&#8221; had his sign displayed, for the
public&#8217;s guidance, was a long low place that had
been used as the carriage house of &#8220;Liberty Stable&#8221;
years before. The tiny windows, high up
in a row along the front, were stall-marks that told
what it had been in the past. Now it was an
&#8220;Emporium&#8221; for all who needed second-hand furniture
at a bargain; or for those who sought antiques
of any kind, to add to their amateur
collections.
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Styne was a white-haired, long-whiskered,
thin man who sat tilted back in a broken-through
rush-bottom chair that had never had a
bid at his weekly auctions, hence it was put to
some use in his office to pay for storage. His feet
were resting on the flat-table-desk in front of him,
and he was sweetly snoring when the girls opened
the door of the room.
</p>
<p>Such an unheard of thing as customers in the
early part of the afternoon, caused him to jump
up and remove his aged straw hat that had been
tilted over his eyes to keep out the sun-light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We came to see if we could find anything in
your salesroom,&#8221; began Mrs. Fabian, noting the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
dust that lay thick on everything, and the heaped
up motley collection of family possessions displayed
in the long adjoining stable-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of furniture do you need?&#8221; asked
he, stifling a yawn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, anything old enough to be interesting.
We heard that you were a wizard in finding antiques
for people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The proprietor disclaimed such power, and said
with a grin that displayed several gaps in his yellowed
teeth, &#8220;You can mosey about, out there, to
your heart&#8217;s content. If you find anything likely,
call me an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell you what it&#8217;s wuth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He waved his arm to the long stacked-up storeroom,
and then sat down again. In another moment
his feet were up on the desk and his hat
tipped down over his eyes. His hands were
calmly folded over his waist-coat and he settled
down to snooze, once more.
</p>
<p>The girls giggled aloud and hurried after Mrs.
Fabian to keep from laughing outright at the ambitious
salesman. They prowled about and pulled
out lots of things and examined many other old
articles, soiling their gloves and dresses, without
finding a thing that was of any value.
</p>
<p>Finally Polly dragged out an old walnut chest
of drawers to see what was stored back of it, that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
kept it so far away from the wall. She discovered
a group of large, framed pictures standing
against the wall, evidently forgotten by the auctioneer,
as they were covered with a thick coating
of dust.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and help me lift these out, will you,
Nolla?&#8221; called Polly, as Eleanor stood waiting
for something new to look at.
</p>
<p>In another moment, both girls were hauling out
the mass of pictures, whose wires and screw-eyes
were so entangled that to get at one, you had to
drag all out at the same time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness! Just look at our hands!&#8221; exclaimed
Eleanor, holding up such dirty hands that
Polly laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The result of digging!&#8221; said she, managing
to separate one smaller frame from the others.
</p>
<p>As she turned it over to study the picture, she
was greatly disappointed to find it had an old,
cheap, stained frame. The picture seemed nondescript
to her. It was a scene of an old bridge
with fine old trees on both banks of the river.
Quaintly costumed people strolled along both
sides of the stream, and a funny tower rose at the
further end of the bridge. The colors were crude
and primary&mdash;no fine shading or artistic handling
to be seen. A title under the picture, and several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
inscriptions in French at the left side of the bottom,
were so stained and blurred as to be totally
unreadable with the naked eye.
</p>
<p>Meantime, Eleanor had managed to free the
next frame, which was a huge affair of old mahogany.
The glass was so dreadfully dusty that not
a bit of the picture underneath could be seen.
She looked about for something to use as a duster,
and saw an old end of chenille curtain on the walnut
dresser. This she used and wiped away as
much of the dirt as would come off with hard
work&mdash;the rest must have hot water and soap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I declare! Look at this old engraving!&#8221;
called she to the others. Polly was at hand,
and saw that Eleanor had actually found a
treasure.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian hurried across the room and took
her magnifying glass from her handbag being always
prepared with it in case of need to study
signatures and other nearly effaced trade-marks.
</p>
<p>The large engraving represented the Independence
Hall at Philadelphia, and under that was the
famous Declaration of Independence, with all the
original signatures following. The picture of the
Hall was engraved on a smaller bit of paper and
had been mounted at the top of the printed matter.
The engraving was signed by the engraver, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
dated. Affidavits at the bottom of the parchment
paper stated that this was one of the original
documents made by Order of Congress for use in the
Government Buildings so that the first original
paper and signatures could be preserved as a relic,
by the United States.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this wonderful old paper is more than
a hundred and thirty years old!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Fabian amazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness me! How much do you suppose
I shall have to pay to get it?&#8221; gasped
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but you really ought to shake
that dirty rag thoroughly over the glass again, to
hide what is under it,&#8221; advised Dodo, with
astuteness.
</p>
<p>The others laughed. But Polly had another
suggestion to make. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what else we can
find in this stack of pictures. We will choose a
number of them and then make an offer on the
lot, as much as to say we need bargain-frames for
other uses. This rare find of Nolla&#8217;s will be
hidden in with the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly&#8217;s idea is best. Because the old man
will know that we wouldn&#8217;t buy a picture with all
the dust covering the glass,&#8221; said Nancy Fabian.
</p>

A CRY FROM POLLY CAUGHT THEIR FULLEST ATTENTION.<br />
<i>Polly&#8217;s Business Venture.</i> <i>Page 139</i>
<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the little old one you&#8217;ve got in your
hands, Polly?&#8221; now asked Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing much. It looks like an ugly little
chromo printed before people knew how to
use colors on printing-presses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian leaned over Polly&#8217;s shoulder to
take a look, and puckered her forehead when she
saw the yellowed paper and old stained edges of
the picture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, I verily believe that here you have
something that Mr. Fabian has lectured on several
times. Let me examine it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While the girls crowded about her, Mrs. Fabian
placed the picture, face downwards, on the
table near by and tried to draw out the old headless
tacks driven in to hold the backboard snugly
in its place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whoever framed this picture did it for
all time!&#8221; exclaimed she, breaking several fingernails
and tearing the skin on her hands in the attempt
to loosen the fine steel nails.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! I&#8217;ve found an old pair of broken scissors
in this desk&mdash;let&#8217;s use them to clinch the nails
and force them out,&#8221; said Nancy, handing her
mother the shears.
</p>
<p>With this assistance, Mrs. Fabian soon had the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
nails out and then carefully removed the old sections
of thin boards. Under the boards was a
yellowed newspaper, folded neatly, and so
wedged in at the edges of the frame that no dust
could work a way through to the picture. Without
a thought of the paper, Mrs. Fabian took it
out and expected to see the back of the picture.
Instead, she found a yellow-stained letter written
to Paul Revere Esq. and signed by one of the famous
men of the Revolution. It was a personal
letter of that time, and had been used to paste
over a crack in the back of the picture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why! How very wonderful!&#8221;
breathed Mrs. Fabian, as she stared at the old
letter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it&mdash;anything valuable?&#8221; asked the
girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A genuine letter written to Paul Revere!
Now that I think of it, girls, Paul Revere lived
in Morristown and his home is still intact on De
Hart Street, I believe. This old picture must
have come from his house; or in some way, this
letter found its way into someone else&#8217;s hands and
was used at that time for scrap paper to mend
this picture. Now let&#8217;s see what the picture
is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But a cry from Polly, who had picked up the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
old newspaper and now had opened it wide, caught
their fullest attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! Isn&#8217;t this too funny for anything!
Listen and I will read it.&#8221; Then Polly read aloud
an advertisement in the tiny old newspaper, of a
Squire at Baskingridge who wished to sell a
healthy, young negro wench of unquestionable
pedigree. Price and particulars would be given
any interested buyer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly!&#8221; chorused her audience, in surprise.
&#8220;That paper must be as old as the letter!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And see, girls!&#8221; added Mrs. Fabian. &#8220;It has
great heavy black borders on the outside. What
for, Polly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly turned over the sheet with utmost care,
as it was so dry and brittle, and to the speechless
astonishment of them all, it showed that the
mourning bands were used for the death of George
Washington. The entire front page was devoted
to the news of his demise which had occurred the
day before going to press. His fame, and value
to the United States, were spoken of, and other
features of his life were touched upon. His picture,
printed from an old wood-cut, headed the
page. All the spelling was such as was common
at that time with the letter &#8220;e&#8221; tacked on when
possible and the old English &#8220;f&#8217;s&#8221; were used for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
&#8220;s&#8217;s&#8221; and long-stemmed &#8220;p&#8217;s,&#8221; and high-browed
&#8220;a&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;i&#8217;s,&#8221; were formed to show readers that
the writer and editor was a well-educated man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my! Must we fold it up and put it back
of that board again?&#8221; sighed Polly, finally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want a bargain, that is what you&#8217;d better
do,&#8221; returned Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the picture is as old as the paper,&#8221;
ventured Polly.
</p>
<p>The thought of the picture had completely vanished
from the mind of Mrs. Fabian when she saw
the rare old newspaper; but now she quickly picked
up the article and turned it over. The magnifying
glass was once more brought to bear upon the
subject, and after several minutes of inspection,&mdash;minutes
of impatient hesitation on the part of the
girls,&mdash;she looked up bewildered with her discovery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, this is really the missing picture that
will complete the set that is on exhibition at the
Metropolitan Museum, in New York. It is one
of the famous color-prints made in France about
the sixteenth century, and the subject is the famous
Bridge at Avignon. This is worth thousands
of dollars, dear, and I hesitate to tell you
what to offer for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly would have taken the rare picture out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
to the still sleeping man and offered him a sum
that would have made him sit up and investigate
the matter for himself. But clever Dodo advised
another method.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you offer more than the old frame is actually
worth, when you say you will pay so much
for the frames&mdash;he will see right off that there&#8217;s
a &#8216;nigger in the woodpile.&#8217; Let&#8217;s tangle up a few
of these old black-walnut frames with the two
valuable pictures, and I&#8217;ll bargain for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better let Mrs. Fabian bargain&mdash;you know
how she got the candle-sticks in exchange for a
two-dollar &#8216;bankit&#8217; lamp,&#8221; Eleanor reminded
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, while you girls keep on poking about
as if to find other things,&#8221; declared Mrs. Fabian.
&#8220;Here, Polly, let us fix this frame up exactly as
it was before, and I&#8217;ll take four out of the pile
and place them, one on top of the other, upon this
dresser, and then call the man out to quote me
a price on the lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was carefully done, dust being shaken out
of the old curtain so that the glass was again
coated, and then dust was shaken over the back
where the board had been removed and cleaned.
</p>
<p>A dreadful lithograph showing a string of fish,
framed in a wide gilt affair, was one that was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
chosen for the group. An oval frame with a
woman&#8217;s photograph in it, was another selected.
Then the four were arranged: The large engraving
at the bottom, the fish next, then the little
old relic, and on top, the oval frame. All
four appeared dirty and insignificant as they lay
on the top of the dresser; and to finish the work,
Polly used the chenille rag to gather up as much
dust as possible from the filthy floor, and shook it
vigorously over all the frames. Such a choking
and coughing as ensued made them separate in
haste, for fear the noise would make the auctioneer
come out to enquire.
</p>
<p>But he was too deeply concerned with some
pleasant dream to awake to business, before his
usual time for the afternoon siesta had ended, so
Mrs. Fabian went out to rouse him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, what did you say?&#8221; exclaimed he, jumping
up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me how much are a few
picture-frames which we found in a corner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, anything you like. How much do you
think they are wuth?&#8221; was his reply.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian smiled pleasantly. &#8220;That is not
what I said. You are the salesman and I the
buyer. You should state a price.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Um&mdash;ah!&#8221; yawned Mr. Van Styne at this, and
stretched his arms out over his head. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose
that ends my nap, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shuffled out of the office after Mrs. Fabian
and went into the store-house. When he saw the
girls poking about amongst the old chairs, bureaus,
and motley collection of furniture, he laughed,
and said: &#8220;That&#8217;s right! Find all the old bargains
you can. I&#8217;m your man to sell them cheap
to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Had he but known what he was about to do!
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian led him down to the corner where
the pile of four pictures were waiting on the
dresser, and said: &#8220;These are the four I want a
price on. The frames are all in good order and
the glasses are not cracked at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Styne took a pair of old steel-rimmed
specs from the vest-pocket over his heart, and
pushed them upon his thin nose. He picked up
the top oval frame, blew off the dust and laughed
at the homely face that stared out at him. He
turned to Mrs. Fabian with a twinkle in his eyes
and said, jokingly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if that gal was your relation and you
wanted her ugly photograph that bad, I&#8217;d say the
hull thing was wuth a dollar to you. But seein&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
it&#8217;s fifty year old, and you ain&#8217;t near that, yet, I
will sell her fer a quarter. The glass is wuth
that, I reckon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He placed it face down beside the other three
pictures. &#8220;Now this one,&#8221; taking up the rare
old print with the newspaper packed in the back,
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t wuth a darn, so why do you pick it out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the glass is the right size and will cost me
more to order, than I can get it for of you,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Fabian, anxiously, while the girls
held their breath.
</p>
<p>The old auctioneer heard the note of anxiety
in her tone and peered over his specs to study her
guileless expression. She instantly guarded herself,
when she saw his look, and so he saw only
a nice lady who was now picking up the fish-picture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this dining-room picture; how much will
you take for <i>it</i>. Why not give me a job-lot price
and I&#8217;ll see. I may as well pack four as two in
the automobile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Mr. Van Styne had not known there was
an automobile; and he was wondering now, why
people with a car should come in and pick out a
few picture glasses to save money. He glanced
over the last picture which was the large engraving,
and then turned it over to look at its back.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a mighty big sheet of glass in that one.
That glass alone, cost about a dollar-forty. Then
the frame&#8217;s a good hard-wood frame, too. I&#8217;ll
look up my books and see who sent them pictures
in for sale. Then I can see if they put a figger
on them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He made notes of the chalk numbers marked
on the backs of the picture-boards and then started
for his office. Mrs. Fabian, with sinking
heart, followed at his heels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he looks up his records and finds they came
from the old house of Paul Revere and his descendants,
he will never sell them at a decent
price,&#8221; thought she, impatiently.
</p>
<p>She sat opposite the old man while he fumbled
the pages of his book and slowly glanced down
the entries, his bent fore-finger pointing to each
item carefully as he read.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um! Here it is: Number 329, came from
Sarah Dolan, who moved to a smaller flat last
Spring. From this entry I see that all them seven
pictures came from her. Do you happen to know
her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Styne glanced up at his companion.
</p>
<p>She shook her head, and he said, closing the
book, &#8220;Why, Sally Dolan was cook fer the Revere
boys, and when they broke up, she started a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
bordin&#8217; house down on Morris Street. Then she
took rheumatiz and was that crippled, she couldn&#8217;t
get about the kitchen no more, so she gave up.
Her boys manage to keep her now, and she takes
things easy. But she sure was a good cook!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Much as Mrs. Fabian would have liked to question
the old man about the Revere boys she feared
he might remember that the cook was given a lot
of old pictures when the boys &#8220;broke up&#8221;, so she
turned the subject adroitly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go and see what the girls have found
out there, I guess. But I wish you&#8217;d fix a price on
those four frames.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lem&#8217;me see, now. Sal Dolan didn&#8217;t set no
price, and if I say five dollars for the four, would
you take &#8217;em?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; objected Mrs. Fabian, craftily.
&#8220;The large one you said was worth about a dollar-thirty,
and the fish-picture a dollar. That leaves
two dollars and seventy cents for the other two.
Isn&#8217;t that pretty high for them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that fish picture makes a fine dinin&#8217; room
piece, especially if you could get the mate what is
a brace of quails.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh well, rather than jew you down, I&#8217;ll take
them, if you will take the trouble to make me out
a receipt for the four.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t this a cash sale?&#8221; queried the man, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, but two of them are for friends. I
only intend keeping the other two. I want them,
to have the bill to show, you see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thereupon Mr. Van Styne wrote out the bill on
a scrap of paper and receipted it, and then counted
the five one dollar bills Mrs. Fabian had paid
him. &#8220;Ten per cent fer me and the rest for
Sally,&#8221; he added as he rolled fifty cents inside
four one dollar bills and pocketed the other fifty
cents.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian was about to go for the pictures,
when Polly came out. &#8220;I want to ask the auctioneer
how much this little box and mirror are?&#8221;
and she showed a lovely little Empire dressing-mirror
to him. It was scratched and had been
varnished, but its former beauty could be quickly
restored, for the form and material were good as
ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m told that is a real antique. That piece
come from the old Revere place, too. Mrs.
Dolan says she heard it was used by the boy&#8217;s
grandmother. But I don&#8217;t know what to
charge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you ten dollars for it,&#8221; eagerly said
Polly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ten dollars!&#8221; gasped the man, sinking back
in his desk-chair.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian tried to signal Polly, but the girl
was too intent on securing the gem. Then Mrs.
Fabian said to the man:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! The child has more money than
brains, eh?&#8221; and laughed heartily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t so sure about that. She certainly
knows a good thing,&#8221; returned Mr. Van Styne.
Then he said to Polly: &#8220;Will you carry it right
along with you, if I sell it for ten?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; declared she, and the sale was
made.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;d better be going, Polly,&#8221; suggested
Mrs. Fabian, now. This told the girl that the
deal over the pictures had been consummated, but
she did not ask questions then.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian went back to gather up her four
precious pictures, and had the other girls help her
carry them away. Then they bid the good old
man good-by and started off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come again, when you have more time to
poke around,&#8221; said he, as he stood on the doorstep
watching them walk towards the car which
was waiting a short distance down the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly will, and if you get anything
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
really antique in the place at any time, drop me
word, or telephone to the address I left on your
desk, just now,&#8221; said Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>Once the hunters were safely on the way to New
York, the girls importuned Mrs. Fabian to tell
them the story of the pictures, but she laughingly
remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, we forgot all about our
luncheon! Poor Carl must be famished!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; retorted Carl. &#8220;I went to that
quick lunch-room across from the old junk-shop,
and got the best dinner for forty cents that
I ever tasted. But we will stop for a picnic, when
we reach the country, if you say so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed! We&#8217;ll eat as we drive along,
Carl,&#8221; said Mrs. Fabian, then turning to the girls,
she told the tale<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of the old pictures and what
she paid for them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; gasped the wondering girls. &#8220;It can&#8217;t
be possible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that, Mrs. Fabian produced the bill of sale
and said: &#8220;I got this in case there ever should be
any dispute over the legality of this negotiation.
The two awful pictures we can give to some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
family along the road, but the two precious ones
we will cherish as if they were the Koh-i-noor
Diamond.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the Ashbys and Mr. Fabian heard the
story, and saw the validity of the two pictures,
they sat astounded. Mr. Fabian then said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly really ought to immortalize her name by
presenting this missing scroll to the Metropolitan
Museum, but she can keep the letter and newspaper.
That ought to be worth the price she
paid for the &#8216;glass&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ll do, Mr. Fabian. I would
never feel happy if I <i>kept</i> a thing that is considered
so rare, and has been sought for by the Museum&#8217;s
collectors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Polly Brewster&#8217;s name is to be found ticketed
as the donor of the twelfth valuable picture in that
set.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>UNEXPECTED NEWS FROM PEBBLY PIT</h3>
</div>

<p>The young collectors experienced the usual
&#8220;red-tape&#8221; in offering the rare picture to the Museum,
and after the customary delays, it was accepted
with letters of thanks. Individual letters
from several officials were written to Polly and
her friends, voicing the appreciation of the men
at being able to complete the series.
</p>
<p>Shortly after this pleasing incident, the girls
went out on another excursion just across the Hudson,
in New Jersey. They took the ferry at One
Hundred and Thirtieth Street, and after reaching
Edgewater, drove through the small towns nestling
on the Hackensack, until they came to the
village of Hasbrouck Heights. All about this
section are old, old houses, and if you hunt keenly
enough, you will find delightful odd bits from
Revolutionary days.
</p>
<p>That evening, upon their return, the girls were
eager to compare their trophies of the day, but the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
maid came in with a day letter for Polly. The
others waited for her to read it, and as she read,
her expression changed perceptibly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! It&#8217;s happened again!&#8221; cried she fearfully,
as she finished the letter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! What has happened?&#8221; anxiously
asked her companions, crowding about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Another slide on Grizzly. This time it has
destroyed <i>everything</i> so that mining the gold is
out of the question,&#8221; and Polly gave the message
to Mrs. Fabian to read aloud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad land-slide on Grizzly. Demolished all
machinery and wiped out the entire surface of
mountain-top. No lives lost, but cave and vein
of ore lost. Topography completely changed.
Wait for summer to start new search and locate
gold. Letter sent to Latimer and Dalken. Ask
them for particulars. John Brewster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Polly! That means that our gold mine
has vanished, and all our income from it will be
stopped!&#8221; cried Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t had any income to stop,&#8221; replied
Polly, cynically. &#8220;About all the good we&#8217;ve ever
had from Choko&#8217;s Find Mine has been violent
physical exercise, expenses and the dreams that
buoy hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her friends laughed in spite of the seriousness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
of the matter, and Eleanor added: &#8220;It also means
that Daddy, and all of our New York investors,
have lost the money they invested in the project.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when Tom Latimer called on me the
evening after our ducking in the Bay, he said
he was not in favor of working on the mine so late
in the season. He thought John was taking
dreadful risks to keep the plant open when snowstorms
and slides were imminent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But John told him that plenty of snow was
just what was needed on the peaks, to cement the
chasms and crevices together that had been opened
by the summer&#8217;s heat and continued drought all
Fall. In case no snow came, he said he would
agree to abandon work when the cold weather
became too severe to remain at that altitude.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This unexpected accident and loss of the mine
does not prevent the output of the lava jewels,
Polly, so there&#8217;ll be no noticeable difference in your
income, will there?&#8221; asked Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Tom explained it all to me. He said
that mine affairs were so involved with the jewel
works at Rainbow Cliffs, that one disaster affected
the other interest. Rainbow Cliffs is part of
Pebbly Pit Ranch, so the Cliffs were incorporated
when work began on the mining of the lava.
Then when trouble at Choko&#8217;s Find Mine started,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
the mines at Rainbow Cliffs were mortgaged to
secure financial aid for the gold mine on the mountains.
So that everything is mixed up now in this
calamity,&#8221; explained Polly, tearfully.
</p>
<p>Soon after this, the telephone rang. Mr.
Latimer said he was coming to call, that evening,
and Mr. Dalken wished to come in at the same
time. Would the girls be home?
</p>
<p>Polly assured him they would, and also that
he would be welcomed as she wished to hear
about the important matters that he could fully
explain to her.
</p>
<p>Soon after eight o&#8217;clock, therefore, Mr. Latimer
and Mr. Dalken were announced. Polly and
Eleanor&mdash;the latter had realized that maybe her
future, because of this disaster to the mine would
not be as luxurious as she had dreamed of&mdash;anxiously
welcomed the two men. Polly lost no time
in polite nothings, but asked, at once, about the
conditions at the mines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you have heard about the trouble?&#8221;
ventured Mr. Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I received a long night letter from home,
this afternoon. But they do not say whether
there is anything left to pay my way in New York,
or whether I ought to start for home,&#8221; said
Polly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>Eleanor was shocked at her words. &#8220;Why,
Polly, surely you have no dread of such being
the case, just because our old gold mine is choked
again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand, Nolla, that starting
work on the mine, and all the machinery for it,
costs so much that not only is the lava mine involved,
but the very ranch is risked. Maybe
father will have to sell out his beloved farm and
go away,&#8221; explained Polly, with quivering lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, Polly,&#8221; hastily came from Mr. Latimer.
&#8220;We are all stock-holders in this venture,
you know, and one man alone does not bear the
costs of the mine and its losses. That is why
Mr. Dalken and I came over, tonight, when we
got word that John had written you. We feared
you might not understand matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I understand father, well enough, Mr.
Latimer. He will never permit anyone to lose
a penny because of him or his interests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he won&#8217;t, Polly, but this mining venture
was as much our interest as yours, or your
father&#8217;s, remember. It seems gone, this time, but
we must take our loss as courageously as we
would our profits. Tom wired me to come and
see you and explain that you need make no change
in any of your plans, as everything would go on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
as usual at the ranch. He and John will devote
all of their time to the Cliffs now, instead of
dividing their attention between the two mines,
as they have been doing, heretofore,&#8221; explained
Mr. Latimer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But your mother wrote me, Polly,&#8221; now said
Mr. Dalken, &#8220;that finances would be rather
strained for the next year, because of this tremendous
outlay on the mines and no income; and the
terrible drought that killed off so many head of
cattle on the ranch this year, makes things look
rather unpromising. I know how practical you
are, and I thought it best to let you hear how
matters stand. Your folks asked me not to mention
it, because they wanted you to finish your
studies here, and there are ample funds to pay
for that. But I took it upon myself to warn you
about going deeply into any antique purchases, in
your auction fever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you did, Mr. Dalken. As you
say, I am not a silly child, and now that I know
exactly how matters are at home, I will see if I
cannot do something while studying in New York,
to pay my own way,&#8221; responded Polly, anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t as bad as that, Child!&#8221; laughed
Mr. Latimer; &#8220;but it is best for you not to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
buy in Fifth Avenue shops, or give away rare old
bargains from the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly smiled. &#8220;Mr. Latimer, this is what I
propose doing to earn my expenses in New York.
Instead of buying old objects for fun, I shall
secure them to sell again and make money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poll is right! And I propose going with
her as the partner in her first business venture!&#8221;
declared Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will you two girls find customers?&#8221;
asked Mr. Dalken, admiring the way they accepted
the news that their gold mine seemed wiped out
for all time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Polly&#8217;ll find a way, never fear!&#8221; declared
Eleanor with fervent faith in her friend&#8217;s ability
to accomplish things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll get Mr. Ashby, first of all, to permit
us to exhibit our goods in his &#8216;odd room&#8217; and we&#8217;ll
pay him a commission for sales, just as other
folks do who wish to exchange, or sell, their antiques,&#8221;
explained Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you girls manage to find such valuable
things as that famous missing picture that the
Museum made such a time over, I should say
you had found a big gold mine in New York instead
of losing a little one in the Rockies,&#8221; said
Mr. Dalken.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>So, shortly after the girls learned that they had
to economise on expenses that year, Polly carried
her old coverlets to Mr. Ashby&#8217;s shop and left
them with him to sell. The fine little mirror had
been restored and was perfectly beautiful. This
was placed on exhibition in the Empire Room of
the Ashby Shop, but scarcely had it had time to
be friendly with other rare objects in that room,
before it was purchased at a high price. Thus
Polly cleared several hundred dollars on the first
sale, and felt encouraged to invest that money in
new purchases.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken gladly sent Carl with the car, to
drive the girls whenever they heard of a place to
visit, but Ruth and Nancy seldom accompanied
them these days. Ruth had school to attend
daily, and Nancy was painting a portrait for a
famous stage beauty who had offered her an attractive
price for the work.
</p>
<p>The girls, with Mrs. Fabian, had gone again
to New Jersey, after their great investment that
day in Van Styne&#8217;s place; but they drove on to
Baskingridge that day, and stopped at several
ancient farm-houses to ferret for old things. At
one of the places, they secured some very old glassware,
also odd pieces of Staffordshire, and a well-nigh
complete set of old Wedgewood dishes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>At another house they got a set of old brass
fire-irons and a crane with all the hangers and
pots complete, just as it had been removed from
the brick fire-place and thrown up in the attic.
</p>
<p>At the third house, Polly became enamored
of a wonderful sampler, and several very old
silhouettes&mdash;the latter, very different from the
kind we are familiar with. As these old relics
were in the attic and were considered valueless,
she got them for a very small sum.
</p>
<p>While Polly was bargaining for these trifles,
Eleanor was in the grandmother&#8217;s room looking
at several marvelous patch-work quilts. The old
dame told Eleanor the story connected with each
quilt; and one, the unusual one of silk pieces, as
well as worsteds, patched in with calico, velvet
and other odd materials, was said to be made of
a collection of famous bits from gowns worn by
the ladies of Revolutionary Days.
</p>
<p>How the old grand-dame ever came into possession
of such a valuable quilt, was beyond
Eleanor&#8217;s comprehension. Then Polly and the
house-wife joined her, and Polly was shown the
quilt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How very interesting,&#8221; remarked she.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ll tell you how it came about,&#8221; explained
Mrs. Johnson. &#8220;We&#8217;ve always lived on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
this place, and when the Army passed this way,
our folks helped out in all sorts of ways.
</p>
<p>&#8220;During the winter that General Washington
and his Lady were stationed at Morristown, there
was lots of doings all about the county. You&#8217;ll
read in the history of Lady Washington, how she
was entertained by the first families about here&mdash;the
Fords, the Footes, and others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our great-grandmother was a fine needlewoman
and went about to the houses making
gowns and cloaks for the ladies. She always
saved the scraps of silk and stuff that was wasted,
and of these she patched several quilts. On the
back of each bit of these materials, she pasted
little book-muslin tickets that had the name and
date printed on it, of the lady and the occasion
she wore the gown. So on the back of each of
these pieces is still to be found the printing of
that ancestress of mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t this interesting!&#8221; exclaimed Polly,
eagerly.
</p>
<p>And Eleanor asked: &#8220;Where are the other
quilts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t exactly know what happened to the
others she made; but this one came right down
from grandmother&#8217;s mother to her, then to my
mother, and now to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Would any price tempt you to sell it?&#8221; asked
Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; on earth, whiles I live. But I haven&#8217;t
any children, and goodness only knows what will
become of the dear old heirloom. Why did you
ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How I would love to own it! Not for its
value in money but really to hold it as a precious
patriotic reminder of those days when the ladies,
even though they dressed fine and had good times,
performed such heroic and almost super-human
deeds for the Army,&#8221; explained Polly.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Johnson gazed keenly at the girl&#8217;s face
for a few moments, then said: &#8220;Tell me your
name and address: I am going to write it out
now, that this quilt is to be yours any time I die;
and you must be as careful of it as we have been.
Always keep tar-paper, or tobacco in it, during
summer when moths fly about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly thanked the lady very seriously and promised
to be most careful of it in every way, but she
said she hoped Mrs. Johnson would live a long
time to enjoy the quilt as her own family relic.
</p>
<p>On the drive back through Morristown that
day, Mrs. Fabian had Carl stop at Mr. Van
Styne&#8217;s auction rooms, but the old man was not in,
and the door was locked. A sheet of paper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
tacked inside the sash of the door, announced that
the owner was at Parsippany numbering household
goods for an auction to be held in two weeks&#8217;
time.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian made a note of the name and location
of the house where the sale was to be held,
and came back to the automobile. She showed
the paper to the girls, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to get out here for that sale. But
I&#8217;ll write Mr. Van Styne first, and ask him what
sort of things the people have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it would be silly to come so far and find
the house contained nothing but horrid old modern
stuff,&#8221; said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Arriving home, late that afternoon, Mrs. Fabian
was given a letter sent from the old auctioneer
at Morristown. He had kept his word
and notified the young collectors of the sale about
to be held at Parsippany: the sale they had heard
about that day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says, in this letter,&#8221; explained Mrs. Fabian
after reading it, &#8220;the old farm-house where
the vendue will take place, is filled with real old
furniture; the family that owned the farm have
held it for five generations. Mr. Van Styne admits
that he is not enough of a connoisseur to
judge the actual value of the antiques, but there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
are some mahogany pieces, and loads of queer old
things that <i>his</i> wife would have kept in the attic,
or split up for kindlings. As he thinks this is
what is now called &#8216;Period Furniture,&#8217; he would
suggest that we run out and have a look at it before
the day of the sale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The letter sounds exactly like him, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
laughed Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but it is very nice of him to be so honest
about it. Most auctioneers would tell us the furniture
was wonderful,&#8221; returned Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you think we can run out there, Mrs.
Fabian?&#8221; asked Eleanor, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find out what day Carl can best arrange
for the trip. We mustn&#8217;t &#8216;drive a willing horse
to death,&#8217; you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Later in the evening, the telephone bell rang
and Polly was called to the &#8217;phone. The maid
who answered the ring said it was a man&#8217;s voice
but she had not been able to understand the name.
</p>
<p>Eleanor heard her chum say: &#8220;Oh, really!
We&#8217;ve been wondering what became of you. It
was so surprising to find you were an old friend
of our Mr. Dalken&#8217;s and then never hear from
you again, or have anyone know where you had
gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian glanced questioningly at Eleanor,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
but the girl shook her head in token of her ignorance
of who the caller could be. Then they
heard Polly say: &#8220;Why, I reckon so. If you&#8217;ll
hold the wire a moment, I&#8217;ll run and ask Mrs.
Fabian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few moments later, Polly rushed into the
room and said eagerly: &#8220;Jack Baxter is on the
&#8217;phone and wants to know if he may come in, tomorrow
evening, Mrs. Fabian. He says he has
a little furniture commission for Nolla and me to
take care of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian immediately replied that the young
man would be welcomed the following evening,
and Polly hurried back to deliver the invitation.
Eleanor waited until she heard the conversation
over the telephone resumed between the two, then
she said to Mrs. Fabian:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet anything, that Jack Baxter is really in
love with Polly! I watched him all that time,
after he was formally introduced by Mr. Dalken,
and he just hung on her every word and act.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian smiled. &#8220;That is the usual experience
the young men have with Polly. I think
the very fact that she is unmindful of her attractions,
coupled with her indifference to the attentions
of the male sex, acts as a spur to them; each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
tries to see if she will not capitulate to his individual
charms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed. &#8220;You speak as if you believed
the young men to be egotistical enough to
<i>think</i> they were charming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They do, Nolla!&#8221; retorted Mrs. Fabian.
&#8220;Every Adam&#8217;s son firmly believes he is more alluring
and attractive to a girl, than his friends.
That is why they all follow tamely after a girl
who has no time for them: they cannot believe it
<i>possible</i> that she is not overcome with their
fascinations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor smiled as she listened, then she remarked:
&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll try Polly&#8217;s strategy and
see if the beaus line up for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no need to experiment with any new
tricks,&#8221; replied Mrs. Fabian, warningly. &#8220;There
are enough sighing young men already, waiting
to break their hearts and necks, for a mere glance
from those impish eyes of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed merrily at her chaperone&#8217;s
words, but Polly&#8217;s return to the room interrupted
their little talk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; demanded Polly, as soon
as she was in the room.
</p>
<p>Not giving them time to answer, she said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
&#8220;Jack Baxter is going to furnish a bachelor apartment
in the city, and says he is going to give Nolla
and me the contract for doing it. It will be our
very first work as interior decorators!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; gasped Eleanor, &#8220;how can we do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly looked amazed at such a question, and
retorted: &#8220;Why, with money and brains, to be
sure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that why he&#8217;s coming tomorrow evening?&#8221;
asked Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he is now staying at Mr. Dalken&#8217;s apartment,
and both of them are coming over tomorrow.
He says he has been West since we last
saw him, and he stopped at Pebbly Pit to see the
folks, on his way back from the Coast. That is
why he has not been heard from&mdash;he was called
away so suddenly, and just got back today.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why he took all the trouble to go to
Pebbly Pit?&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t know a
soul there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I asked him, and he says he will
tell us all about it tomorrow night,&#8221; explained
Polly.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>POLLY&#8217;S FIRST CONTRACT</h3>
</div>

<p>Promptly at eight, Jack Baxter and Mr. Dalken
were announced to Polly and Eleanor. The
Fabians had gone to the Opera and Mr. Dalken
was supposed to act as chaperone for the evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a new experience for me,&#8221; laughed
he, &#8220;but not one that I dislike. In fact, I will
be glad to offer my services in the same capacity,
at any time, for you girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better beware how you offer yourself on such
an altar,&#8221; teased Polly, trying to appear calm and
composed, whereas she was keyed up to hear about
the proposed work young Baxter wished them to
do for his new apartment.
</p>
<p>Eleanor deemed it wise to mention another subject
first, so she asked: &#8220;How long were you at
Pebbly Pit, Mr. Baxter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the reasons we came over to
see you,&#8221; interpolated Mr. Dalken. &#8220;Jack has
a lot to tell you about the troubles there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What troubles?&#8221; wondered Polly. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t mean the land-slide, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know about that,&#8221; added Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You only heard the first news of it. But you
never knew what followed that first event,&#8221; returned
Mr. Dalken. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known how things
stood for a short time, but I talked it over with
the Latimers, and we decided to let Jack go West
with Mr. Alexander, and investigate matters for
themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dodo&#8217;s father! What has he to do with
it?&#8221; asked both girls in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;More than we can ever appreciate. Because
he is such an experienced old miner, having spent
years in the Klondike, and later, down in the Colorado
mining districts, his going to Pebbly Pit was
the best thing that ever happened to our company.
Jack had just decided to invest a great
deal of his capital in the joint companies, so he
decided to accompany Alexander and see for himself
how the land lay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what was Mr. Alexander&#8217;s verdict?&#8221;
asked Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to Jack&#8217;s story of what happened on
the mountain, that early morning. It is as thrilling
as anything I ever heard,&#8221; said Mr. Dalken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have given anything to have been on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
spot when that old peak divided her earthly substance,&#8221;
laughed Jack. &#8220;But even the telling of
it by Tom Latimer and John Brewster, was so exciting
that I tried every way possible to reach the
mountain where the awful avalanche took place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom had felt a tremor run along the side of
the peak the night before, and had warned John
that old Grizzly was ripping mad again. So the
two of them rode along the Crest where those
claim-jumpers were buried the time that other
avalanche occurred, and they saw that Grizzly
Slide had broken up great masses of ice-field, and
on the far side where it drops suddenly to the
valley, thousands of feet below, a great block of
ice and rock had fallen from the top-side and had
rolled down, destroying everything in its terrific
plunge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Both boys were satisfied that it was only a
matter of time before the gaping crevices showing
on the side towards the gold mine, would widen
and the top-mass begin to move. It was impossible
to say whether a slide would happen on the
cave-side or roll down one of the gulleys on either
side of the mine. But the two of them made up
their minds that everyone must move from the
camp without delay, and seek safety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Orders were given to strike camp at once, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
the men worked all night, packing away outfits
and tools, and such machinery as could be moved
inside the cave. Then the mouth was closed
against winter storms, and they started, on their
horses, to ride along Top Notch Trail, on the
down trip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was almost noon when they left the mine,
and by two o&#8217;clock they halted on one of the crests
to cook dinner. The horses were hobbled where
a patch of Buffalo grass provided good pastureage,
and Rattlesnake Mike started a fire to cook
the meal. Tom and John got out their tackle to
catch a few trout, when a fearful roll of thunder
sounded along the crest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She come down, pooty queeck!&#8217; exclaimed
Mike, startled out of his usual calmness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you mean Old Grizzly?&#8217; Tom asked him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But before he could reply, there was such a
crash and roar, and the whole ground shook under
their feet as if an earthquake had caused it.
Everyone stood aghast looking at what had been
snow-capped Grizzly but a moment before. So
astonished were the men that they couldn&#8217;t speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The roar and tumult continued so seemingly
close at hand, that the men ran for their horses,
and would have ridden down the trail had not
Mike laughed and applied a match to the kindling,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
just as if nothing was happening above them on
Grizzly Slide. It instantly quieted the fears of
the others, and they turned again to wait for further
events.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Latimer says, that what caused such a
panicky feeling in them all, was the fact that one
moment they had seen the glistening cap of Old
Grizzly, and the next, it was gone, and a great
cloud of flying white particles hid the scene for a
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The terrific detonation they heard immediately
after the peak&#8217;s snow-cap rolled down the mountain-side,
was caused by the mass of rock, ice,
snow and general débris, striking the ground below.
How far it fell before striking, they could
not say, but Mike claims it must have been hurtled,
from the peak of Grizzly, to the great gulch
that runs along its lower side, about five thousand
feet below&mdash;all that distance before landing and
filling the ravines about that section.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the way down, from Grizzly Gulches to
the bottoms that run along Bear Forks branches,
the avalanche tore up trees, boulders, moraine,
and other heavy matter, that generally forms a
dam for smaller slides than this one was. But
this time, entire forests were shoved along, still
standing, just like a great cake of icing with fancy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
frosting of colored sugar on top of it, is pushed
off from a slice of birthday cake, when the knife
loosens it. The moment any part of this avalanche
came up against a cliff, or rolled over into
vast ravines, that much of the sliding forest tumbled
up against itself, or fell into the gulch to
instantly fill up the cleft and cause the remaining
slide to roll over it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The end of that avalanche did not come until
it reached the valley of Bear Forks, just below
Pebbly Pit ranch. If your home had not been
snugly located up in that crater, but had been
down in the valley by the river, it would have
been completely covered with the tons of trash
that still remained after having rolled for miles,
and finally worn itself out on the banks of the
stream.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the branches of Bear Forks that start up
on the side of the mountain, are choked, and the
waters rushed in every direction, starting smaller
slides by up-rooting trees and loose stones and
shale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The miners followed Mike&#8217;s example, and ate
a hearty dinner, although they were all crazy to
ride back and ascertain the extent of the damage
caused. Mike was for their going quietly on
home, but not one of the others would agree to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
this. So they turned back and rode as far as the
trail was passable. But they could not climb over
the great mass of débris that was piled up, shortly
after leaving Four Blaze Tree. And the queer
sensation of not seeing the old familiar top on
Grizzly Peak, unnerved them for further adventure
that day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They got home past midnight, to hear the account
of what happened as witnessed by Anne,
and Mr. and Mrs. Brewster.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At the first rolling of the slide, Anne ran out
of the ranch-house and watched anxiously, as she
knew the men were up at the mine. She saw
such a strange sight that she rubbed her eyes to
make sure she was not dreaming. She says, she
saw the top of Old Grizzly break right off as if
someone had cleft it at a given point down from
the peak. And this gigantic mass of ice, still
glittering in the sun-rays, toppled down until she
heard the crash and roar and felt the earth shake
under her feet even at that great distance from
the Peak that the ranch was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The ranch-house and the out-buildings shook
as in a quake, and caused everyone to run toward
the terrace that runs along the edge of the crater.
There they stood watching clouds of snow float up
over the forests that, one moment were to be seen,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
and the next were moving swiftly down the mountain
sides.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The folks feared the men at the mine had been
killed, as the avalanche was the greatest they had
ever heard of in that vicinity, so Mr. Brewster
rode madly to Oak Creek to get some men to go
with him to see if any signs of his boys could be
found.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They met them at Lone Pine Blaze, and Tom
said that John&#8217;s father sat still and sobbed like a
child, with relief at finding everyone in his mining-party
safe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Miss Polly, the gold mine is closed by Nature,
for untold repairs. Whether this generation
will ever locate the ore and dig out the tools
and machinery buried in the cave, remains to be
seen. But I was so infatuated with life in the
Rockies during the short visit I had there, that I
determined to put in all the cramming at college
that was possible, and finish my education so I
could go out there to join Tom Latimer and
John Brewster in their exciting engineering
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Jack had concluded his story, the girls
seemed rather downcast at the knowledge that
their little mine was gone, but Mr. Dalken said
to young Baxter:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You may as well tell them about the Cliffs,
and have all the mourning over at one time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly glanced anxiously from Mr. Dalken to
Jack, and then at Eleanor, but the young man explained
without waiting longer: &#8220;All the miners
working at Rainbow Cliffs went on a big strike
shortly after the calamity on Grizzly Slide, and
so unreasonable were their demands that Mr.
Brewster refused to grant them. That stopped
work on the lava jewels, too, and everything is
closed down until next year. Of course, while
there is no work going on, there are no wages to
pay, but there is also no income from the vast
amount of money invested in machinery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, then really, I am a pauper for the
time being,&#8221; exclaimed Polly, but not in a distressed
tone as one would expect after such dire
news.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother told me most emphatically, that
that was <i>not</i> the case. Everyone at Pebbly Pit
seems to want you to continue with your studies
until you have finished; and your father said there
was a tidy fortune in a Denver bank for you, so
that no matter what happened to others, you were
amply provided for. With your business that
you wish to take up, you will not have to worry
over the future,&#8221; explained Jack Baxter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>Eleanor remembered that Mr. Dalken had invested
heavily in these two Pebbly Pit ventures,
and now she turned to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will everyone connected with those two mines
lose a great deal of money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father, the Latimers, the Evans&#8217;, myself
and John Brewster hold equal shares of stock,
but Polly&#8217;s father holds twice as much as anyone
else, for he holds Polly&#8217;s stock as her guardian as
well as his own. The Montresor Estate, representing
the heirs of Kenneth&#8217;s uncle who first discovered
the mine on Grizzly, and then willed
it to Polly who later re-discovered the same
vein of ore in the cave, hold the same number
of shares in the stock-company as either of us,
although they did not furnish any cash for their
stock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Ebeneezer Alexander told Jack to tell
us, that he simply could not stand city-life another
day. And, after enjoying the freedom and open
life of the Rockies again, he was determined to
stay at Pebbly Pit and see the tangle worked out.
His experience will be most valuable to Tom and
John, who are only young engineers, after all.
And Mr. Brewster is a stock-grower with no
knowledge of mining. So we think it is a good
plan to let Mr. Alexander take up some of our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
shares, and sell him an interest in the future of
these mines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone can pull Choko&#8217;s Find Mine out of
the grave it is buried in, old Ebeneezer can do it.
He has such energy and perseverance that nothing
daunts him&mdash;excepting big cities.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And titles!&#8221; added Eleanor, making her
friends laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad to hear he will stay there to help.
I like him so much!&#8221; declared Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now that most of our evening was given
to the story about the land-slide on Grizzly, how
much time am I to be given for the furnishing of
my apartment?&#8221; asked Jack Baxter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just talking about it won&#8217;t furnish it,&#8221; retorted
Polly, smilingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but we can get at first principles, can&#8217;t
we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; if both sides know on what basis each
wishes to start!&#8221; said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know my side of it, and I really think you
girls know yours. This is my basis: I have two
large rooms and bath near Fifth Avenue, that I
want a decorator to do in keeping with the style
of the rooms. I don&#8217;t care where or how you
get the items for furnishing, but I&#8217;d like some of
the fun of going about with you when you visit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
odd corners of the country to dig up the antiques.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you waste your time that way, how do you
expect to finish a hurried education in engineering?&#8221;
asked Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, furnishing won&#8217;t last long, and studying
will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Mr. Dalken is a conscientious executor of
your estate I should think he&#8217;d forbid your wasting
any time hunting up furniture and hiring decorators
to do it for you, at the same time,&#8221; teased
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken laughed and said: &#8220;I always said
&#8216;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jack can work for two whole weeks before
he gets any play, as far as going to a sale
is concerned. There will be no sale, that we
know of, until the old house at Parsippany is sold
in two weeks,&#8221; explained Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have to wait as long as that, I hope,
for my apartment. I&#8217;m paying rent on it already,
and am stopping with Mr. Dalken as his guest,
until I get a bed and a chair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought you wanted to furnish by going
to the sales of antiques,&#8221; ventured Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, but I want to go to one tomorrow.
Can&#8217;t you girls contract to escort me to places in
the city where we can get things without waiting?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As far as that is concerned, we can take you
right over to the Ashby Shop and find everything
on earth you can use, right in his collections,&#8221;
said Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to feel that you two girls were getting
this contract and the profits, and not a famous
establishment,&#8221; demurred Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have the contract, all right, but we will
only buy what we need from Mr. Ashby, at regular
discount, you know,&#8221; explained Eleanor in a
business-like manner.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken smiled indulgently on his two
young friends who had developed such marvelous
aptitude for business since their trip abroad that
summer. And young Baxter concluded with:
&#8220;All right; tomorrow, you girls get Mrs. Fabian,
and come over to my rooms to get your &#8216;atmosphere.&#8217;
Then we&#8217;ll start in and shop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the next ten days were filled with a great
many visits to the apartment to determine certain
colors and styles of things, and with a great deal
of important conferring between the client and
the decorators. But eventually, the apartment
was almost ready for its occupant, and three
young people declared that the decorating was a
work of art&mdash;simply perfect! And it did not
cost so <i>very</i> much, either! Mr. Dalken reserved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
his opinion on costs, however, and laughed in his
sleeve at Baxter, for the latter had no more need
of an apartment than a cat has for two tails. It
was a whim of his to give the girls a contract, and
Jack could afford whims, so his guardian said
nothing about the bills.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must say,&#8221; said Polly the day after
Jack held a &#8220;house-warming&#8221; in his newly furnished
domain, &#8220;I never saw ten days go by as fast
as these did. Here we are almost on top of that
sale in the country, and it seems like yesterday
that we got the announcement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows how much we really love our profession,&#8221;
said Eleanor, &#8220;when we get so much
pleasure out of work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Dodo was present at some of the conferences
the two amateur decorators held with Jack
and she now remarked: &#8220;Work! did you two
think that going about in Jack&#8217;s sporty car and
lunching at swell dining-rooms, or holding up a
strip of gold-gauze to watch the sheen on your
hand, was hard work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian laughed to herself at the conversation.
But Polly answered with an experienced
air: &#8220;When you have had years of study in decorating,
like Nolla and I have had, you will find
that work is not altogether a physical effort. At
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
present, in your apprenticeship, you do more than
you saw us do in furnishing, but you&#8217;ll learn, some
day!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dodo tossed her head confidently, and remarked:
&#8220;I have nothing more to learn&mdash;if
your knowledge is the acme of the understanding
of your trade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As no reply was given this statement, Mrs. Fabian
hurried from the room to laugh quietly to
herself at the egotism of youth. Later when Mr.
Ashby was told the story, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;When they have been at the profession for
thirty years, and have acquired all the knowledge
that I have in that time, they will begin to learn
that we all know very little of harmony and perfect
ideals in decorating.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE PARSIPPANY VENDUE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a lovely late Fall day when Carl
brought Mr. Dalken&#8217;s car around to the Fabian&#8217;s
residence to drive the girls to the Parsippany sale.
Jack Baxter was seated beside Carl and announced
to the girls as they came out with Mrs. Fabian:
&#8220;I&#8217;m invited to go with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who asked you?&#8221; was the rejoinder from
both girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Carl did. He gets tired of chauffing for
hours without rest. So I offered to help him
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Of course, Carl&#8217;s uncomfortable flush showed
that Jack was joking, but he was a welcome addition
to the small party, so they started off, a
merry quartette.
</p>
<p>As there had been no time to drive out, so far,
to inspect the household goods for sale, it had
been postponed until the day of the sale. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
Fabian said that should there be nothing desirable
at the old house, they could go on and have another
hunt about the country.
</p>
<p>But the sale promised to be an interesting one,
for the moment the girls found out that the house
they were looking for was an old Colonial two-story
farm-house, with wings at each side, they
felt sure of its contents being worth-while.
</p>
<p>They parked the car out in a large carriage-house
and walked over to the front door. It was
a true type, with sunburst window over the door,
and a wonderful old knocker on the front panel
of the door. A narrow high window at each side
had diamond panes in them. There was a dear
little hood over the doorway that someone called
a &#8220;rain-shed.&#8221; And on each side of the &#8220;stoop&#8221;
which was reached by three steps, was a high-backed
wooden seat, with funny low arms at the
outer ends.
</p>
<p>The windows of the entire house were filled
with small-paned sash, the glass being green and
wavy in some panes, and as cloudy as mist in
others. Then again other panes were of really
clear white glass. The city visitors found later,
that these old panes were the original old glass
set in by the first owner.
</p>
<p>But they did not come to admire the outside,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
so they all went indoors to look about. They entered
upon a tiny entry.
</p>
<p>The front parlor was a small band-box-like
room with a chimney piece at one side, and a stove-pipe
hole in it for winter use. Alongside the
chimney was a narrow cupboard that was meant
to hold books, or other things, to keep the parlor
from being &#8220;cluttered up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Directly opposite the chimney was a long, high-backed
settee, with haircloth covering. The
frame was old mahogany and the shape hinted at
Chippendale, with its six feet having beautiful
lines, and the side arms curving graciously out to
invite one to be seated.
</p>
<p>In this best room were, also, several rush-bottomed
stencilled chairs, and a Boston Rocker.
An inlaid Hepplewhite table stood against the
wall between the two front windows, with its drop-leaf
raised against the wall. A number of old
pieces of brass and pewter stood on the table.
Over it hung an early Georgian mirror but the
reflection one got when gazing into it was
terrifying.
</p>
<p>From the parlor, the collectors went to the
long living-room that occupied one wing of the
house. Here was a great open fire-place with
crane, and everything used in olden times for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
keeping a fire in good order. Over the mantel
hung a wonderful old mirror with a colored picture
of Washington crossing the Delaware in its
upper panel.
</p>
<p>A rare Empire table with both leaves up,
stood in the middle of the room, and Polly instantly
made up her mind to own that table, if
nothing more that day.
</p>
<p>As they went about admiring the antiques, Jack
said: &#8220;Gee! But I&#8217;m sorry we furnished the
apartment so soon. What a lot of fine things
we might have had at this sale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Eleanor laughingly remarked: &#8220;Sell
your flat out like so many New Yorkers do, and
start in again on another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the low-ceiled, wide dining-room, they found
the typical round mahogany table with twelve
chairs&mdash;two arm and ten side chairs. The seats
were covered with rep, but must have had haircloth
on them at one time. The backs were very
low and curved away from the small of the back
in a frightened manner. There was but one
cross-piece in the back and that was curved also.
</p>
<p>The side-board was nearly eight feet long, with
six claw feet, and a high top. On it stood a tea-caddy
of mahogany, a knife-box, and several silver
boxes. All of them must have been over a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
hundred years old. Very old china and glassware
stood on the large table, ready to be sold.
The collectors saw many desirable pieces there,
but they were too anxious to visit the upstairs to
stop, then, and examine the plates and other
pieces.
</p>
<p>There were four large square rooms on the
second floor and in each one, stood a wonderful
four-poster bed&mdash;two with canopy-tops and two
without. Empire work-tables were in two rooms,
and besides the high chests of mahogany drawers,
and low dressing-tables with tiny front drawers
to hold the comb and brush, there were also ottomans,
foot-stools, and ornamental pieces. Mirrors
hung over each mantel, and old-fashioned
prints and paintings were on the walls.
</p>
<p>By the time Mrs. Fabian and the girls went
downstairs again, they were dumbfounded to find
that a farm-house so near to Morristown and
railroad stations, should have preserved such a
wonderful lot of old mahogany furniture without
having been discovered by collectors. But being
strangers to the other people now gathering for
the sale, they did not speak of their wonderment.
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Styne was late, and as soon as he arrived
he began in the kitchen, without any greeting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
to his followers. There seemed to be a far
different type of buyer at this sale, than the girls
had found at any of the little sales in Westchester;
and once the auctioneer began on the antique
pieces, the prices ran up alarmingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That man standing over there just paid a hundred
and sixty dollars for that Colonial secretary,&#8221;
whispered Polly, annoyance expressed in
her tone for she had been bidding on the same
piece.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look as if he had sixty cents in his
purse,&#8221; said Eleanor, scornfully.
</p>
<p>A lady standing beside her, looked at the buyer
and smiled. &#8220;That man is one of the buyers of
one of the largest antique collectors in New
York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is!&#8221; gasped Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the collector?&#8221; asked Polly, but the
woman saw a little Toby put up for sale, just then,
and she wanted to bid on it, so Polly never heard.
</p>
<p>Anything that could boast of being a hundred
years old, or more, brought fabulous prices, and
the girls were amazed to hear names that they
had read of in the columns of the New York
papers, called out by the cashier, but never
dreamed they would come face to face with the
owners thereof.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>Jack Baxter spied a woman he knew, and finally
brought her over to meet Mrs. Fabian and the
girls. This lady was a social leader in the City,
and furnished much interesting information to
her new acquaintances, about others present who
were buying.
</p>
<p>That sale taught Polly that it was not always
the farm-houses that furnished the rarest bargains
at a sale, especially when that farm was in
proximity to a well-known residential suburb.
But she also found that not everyone who attends
a public sale, and bids anxiously, knows the value
of what they are bidding on.
</p>
<p>Thus it transpired, that she secured several of
the finest antiques in the house, because others
knew nothing of their true records or had overlooked
the objects because of their unattractive
finish or form.
</p>
<p>Jack furnished much amusement to his friends
by bidding on everything the girls did not want.
And the most amusing part of it was, he seldom
secured a thing he bid on. He finally grew so
desperate in his bidding, because Polly laughed at
his luck, that the people frowned upon him as
being a &#8220;professional capper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Styne overheard that remark and was
furious.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want you all to know that I am an honest
auctioneer! I never had a booster in my life,
and I&#8217;ve sold for nigh onto fifty years. That
nice-looking young man you call a &#8216;capper&#8217; is a
friend of some friends of mine from New York,
out here to buy antiques. To prove it to you-all,
that young lady there, next the young man, is the
one who gave the &#8216;Metropolitan&#8217; the rare print
she found in my shop. So there! I reckon that
will hold you, for a time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The surprise felt by the buyers at this news
about Polly, was instantly followed by a general
laugh at the auctioneer&#8217;s final remark to them.
Baxter laughed at the interruption, but Polly felt
very uncomfortable with so many eyes turned her
way. Mr. Van Styne, never dreaming of having
made personal remarks, now continued his sale.
</p>
<p>The antique furniture in the upstairs chambers
brought higher prices than Polly had seen similar
pieces on sale at the antique shops in New York,
and she wondered still more that a country auction
should bring forth buyers who were willing
to pay such high prices.
</p>
<p>Finally, feeling sure that there were no more
bargains for them that day, Polly led the way
downstairs. Young Baxter tried to persuade
her to remain and try for a high-boy she had admired,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
but she refused to give the high bids demanded.
So Jack stayed when the others left the room.
</p>
<p>Down on the side-porch, while waiting for Carl
to come from the carriage sheds, a well-dressed
lady accosted Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the auctioneer say you presented a
rare print to the Museum in New York City. I
should be pleased to hear about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She handed Polly a card. Upon reading the
name of one of the best known amateur collectors
in New York, Polly forgot to reply. Mrs. Fabian
smiled and spoke for her, to give her time to
recover from her surprise. After introducing
the girls, Mrs. Fabian mentioned the fact that
Polly and Eleanor took advantage of every sale
in or about the City, in order to familiarize themselves
with such articles as they would need in
their profession.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, are you studying this line of work?&#8221;
asked the lady, deeply interested at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have given several years to the study,
already, and last Summer we went abroad to visit
the best known places where antiques and collections
were to be seen,&#8221; replied Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, my dears, this is my lucky day. I
want someone to do this sort of work for me, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
I want only such interested individuals who love
the collecting for itself, and not alone for wages.
Also, I want someone who can tell a Sheraton
piece from Empire. If you girls will accept a
proposition from me, I will be glad to talk it over,
some morning, with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly smiled and said: &#8220;If your orders do not
interfere with our studies and other work, we will
gladly accept the work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So, by the time Jack Baxter hurried down the
stairs, Polly and Eleanor had made a new connection
with one of New York&#8217;s social leaders.
Jack looked about for his friends, for a moment,
and then smiled in surprise as he rushed forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mrs. Courtney! I am delighted to see
you here. Did you just arrive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it isn&#8217;t Jack Baxter! No, my boy, I
came out this morning thinking this was a <i>bona
fide</i> antique sale. To my disgust, I found it was
&#8216;fixed&#8217; by a clever dealer from the city, who
chooses just such suburban towns as are famous
for its millionaire residents, then he plans a campaign.
He was wise enough, this time, to engage
Mr. Van Styne to do the selling for him, as the
old man is so popular with the people of his town,
and he is a splendid auctioneer, at the same time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly was dumbfounded. &#8220;Do you mean to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
say that anyone would take the trouble to ship
out all these antiques, so far from the city, just
to catch a lot of buyers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney laughed. &#8220;Of course, my dear.
People will take any amount of trouble to make
a few extra dollars. This dealer owns his own
trucks, and why not let them put in a day&#8217;s work
carting a load of furniture here, if he can get twice
as much for his goods as in New York? All he
has to do, is to find the right type of old house
conveniently near the city for motoring and large
enough to show off his wares to the best advantage.
This man is clever enough, too, to select
only such places as are rich with Revolutionary
lore, and near enough to the estates of the rich to
be an attraction to owners to come. Then he
mails announcements to his city clientele, also.
That is how I heard of the sale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack frowned angrily. &#8220;I suppose that darned
old high-boy I just bought for a top-notch figure,
could have been purchased at this man&#8217;s city shop
for half the price! Now I have to pay to have
it crated and shipped back to New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this &#8216;fixer&#8217; will move it back in his trucks
for a neat sum,&#8221; said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Her companions laughed. Polly then reminded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
him: &#8220;I said <i>not</i> to bid on it! I knew
it would go too high for us to bother with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Carl now drove up to the house, and Mrs.
Courtney bid them good-day, having reminded
Polly that she and Eleanor were to telephone her
at their first opportunity.
</p>
<p>Polly could not help speaking of the &#8220;fixed&#8221;
sale of antiques, and Eleanor said: &#8220;That is
why everything brought such awfully high prices.
The articles must have had a set price on them
to begin with, and when Mr. Van Styne offered
a thing, the dealer was there to run it to a figure
beyond the given price on the books. I am surprised
that the old auctioneer would do such a
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he knew the sale was what we
call &#8216;padded&#8217;; for he seems too conscientious a
man to lend himself to such a deception,&#8221; remarked
Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was just hired to sell the stuff, regardless
of how it got out to Parsippany, and told to
follow book-orders, he had no choice, had he?&#8221;
asked Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks such an honest old fellow, I don&#8217;t
believe he even knew the goods came from a New
York dealer. Just because he <i>is</i> so honest, is one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
reason why people who knew him will listen to
his advice and for the same reason a clever New
York dealer would hire him. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised,
if you girls hear from him, some day, to
the effect that he is shocked to learn that this sale
was not on the level as far as the yarn went,&#8221; said
Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d feel better if he did. I really feel
hurt, now, to think he might be as tricky as that
other dealer,&#8221; said Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it would not be called &#8216;tricky,&#8217; Polly, in
clever business circles,&#8221; said Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not, but to me it looks a lot like selling
goods under false representations. I&#8217;d rather
not sell anything than have to sell that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you come right down to &#8216;brass tacks&#8217;
and study out the whole scheme of things, Polly,
we might be accused of tricky works, too,&#8221; remarked
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; demanded Polly,
astonished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when you think of how we got that pair
of old candle-sticks in exchange for a brass lamp!
We had no lamp to exchange, but Mrs. Fabian
rushed off to a store and got one. Then there
were those old pictures at Van Styne&#8217;s. We were
afraid he&#8217;d suspect them of being valuable, so we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
dusted them well again, as they had been originally,
and placed them with two others to make a
&#8216;job lot&#8217; of them, to hide the facts about them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; remonstrated Polly, &#8220;the lady who
had no use for the candle-sticks <i>did</i> want a brass
lamp the worst way. And Sally Dolan, who
never appreciated the pictures when she had them,
<i>did</i> appreciate the money we paid for them&mdash;while
we appreciated the old things other folks
failed to value.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly is right, there, Nolla,&#8221; added Mrs. Fabian.
&#8220;I do not see a trick in giving a person
exactly what they ask for a thing&mdash;whether they
realize the true value of it, or not. That is their
affair. In Law, the Judge says there is no excuse
or cause, for mitigating a sentence because the
prisoner claims he was ignorant of consequences
of a deed. So it is in other lines: Ignorance
can never claim excuse from consequences&mdash;whether
it be a sale of a candle-stick or a piece
of old land that turns out to have gold on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I should say, ignorance on the part of
the buyers at this vendue, exonerates the dealer
from all blame,&#8221; said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Legally it does, but we were thinking of the
moral,&#8221; explained Mrs. Fabian.
</p>
<p>When the collectors reached the Fabian house,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
Jack seemed loath to go on, so Mrs. Fabian invited
him in to have a bite with them at an informal
dinner.
</p>
<p>It had been plainly evident for some time, that
the only interest Jack Baxter had taken in furnishing
his apartment, or in going about to hunt out
old antiques, was because it gave him plenty of
opportunities to be with Polly. And as is often
the case, when one is completely absorbed in a
pursuit, Polly was the last one to suspect the truth
of this.
</p>
<p>But he forgot discretion that evening, at dinner,
and permitted too much of his attention to
be directed Polly&#8217;s way. Even this might have
been overlooked had not an interruption occurred
while at the table.
</p>
<p>The telephone bell was heard, and shortly afterward,
the maid came around to Polly&#8217;s side and
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Mr. Latimer on the wire, Miss Polly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor was all interest at once: &#8220;Can it be
Jim, or Tom, I wonder?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly was excusing herself at the moment, but
turned to add: &#8220;You know very well that Tom
has his hands full at the mines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor flushed, for she had almost given away
a secret that Paul had told her in his last letter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
Thus far she had kept quiet about the confidence.
</p>
<p>Polly ran from the room, and Jack Baxter
scowled at his plate. Mr. Fabian smiled at his
face and tried to engage him in conversation.
But Polly&#8217;s continued absence annoyed the youth,
so that he lost his appetite, and, in fact, all interest
in any subject started.
</p>
<p>Polly skipped back after a time, her face
wreathed in smiles. &#8220;You will never guess who
I was talking to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Everyone but Jack pretended not to know, but
he blurted out: &#8220;When I was out at the ranch,
that Tom Latimer said something about coming
East for the Winter months&mdash;as long as Alexander
proposed to stay out there and take a hand
in the work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this is the first word you&#8217;ve said about
it,&#8221; said Polly, amazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had I known you were so deeply interested in
the plans of young Latimer, I would have told
you immediately,&#8221; said Jack, with sarcasm born
of jealousy in his voice.
</p>
<p>Polly refused to answer him, and immediately
asked Mrs. Fabian to excuse her from dinner as
she wished to dress for the evening.
</p>
<p>The rest of the family finished the meal with
the uncomfortable sense of Jack&#8217;s having lost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
caste in Polly&#8217;s estimation. He felt it himself,
and it certainly did not tend to make him more
agreeable that evening.
</p>
<p>As soon after dinner as could be politely managed,
Jack spoke of a theatre engagement and
excused himself. His hostesses felt easier when
the door slammed upon him, for they dreaded
having Tom announced while his rival was there,
and then have the whole evening spoiled by both
young men glowering at each other.
</p>
<p>While Eleanor and Nancy ran upstairs to dress
for the evening, the former whispered: &#8220;If Tom
remains in New York all this winter, I bet he&#8217;ll
<i>get</i> Polly before he goes back to the mines, or else
he&#8217;ll &#8216;cook his goose&#8217; for all time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nancy laughed merrily, and said: &#8220;No goose
will be cooked if Polly knows it! But I&#8217;ll wager
you a box of candy, Nolla, that Tom will <i>not</i> get
his girl before he goes back to the mines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Nanc! That&#8217;s a wager; a five-pound
box of the best <i>bon bons</i>, that Tom and
Polly will be engaged before the end of this winter
season!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>TOM MEANS BUSINESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Polly&#8217;s friends had not completed their dressing
when Tom was announced, but she was waiting
in the cozy library; so Tom crossed the long
formal parlor in a few strides, when he caught
sight of her in the softly shaded light of the floor-lamp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly! Oh, but I&#8217;m glad to see you again!&#8221;
breathed he as he caught both hands and devoured
her smiles with his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hope you would be glad! Isn&#8217;t
everyone I know glad to see me after they have
been absent a long time?&#8221; laughed Polly, in a
matter-of-fact tone.
</p>
<p>But Tom glanced hastily about the room.
Then he quite unexpectedly leaned forward and
caught her face between his palms. &#8220;Polly
Brewster, I&#8217;m going to salute you with a brotherly
kiss!&#8221; whispered Tom, and immediately, he
pressed a kiss upon her red lips&mdash;but Polly felt
sure it was <i>not</i> like John&#8217;s kisses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>She tried to free her head from his powerful
hands, but he laughed masterfully and held her
under the light while he gazed into her eyes.
Finally Polly felt herself growing warm and
flushed, and to stop his look she closed her eyes
and began kicking at his shins.
</p>
<p>With a happy laugh, Tom freed her face and
picked her up in his arms. In three long strides
he was over at the divan where he placed her,
sitting upright. Then he sat down beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;Tom Latimer!&#8221; gasped Polly, angrily,
trying to rearrange her hair which had become
tumbled in the fray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;Tom Latimer!&#8221; laughed he, mimicking
Polly very cleverly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know <i>this</i> Tom,
do you, girl! But this is the Tom that you&#8217;ll
know hereafter. I&#8217;m through acting like a
woolly lamb just because Anne says that&#8217;s the
only way to get a girl! You&#8217;re a Rocky Mountain
girl and the only way to make you notice, is
to use ranch methods to lasso you. That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;m here in New York. Catch me letting a rich
society darling like that Baxter spend the winter
months making love to you, when I&#8217;m wasting
my heart away at Pebbly Pit, hoping against hope
for a nice long letter from you!&#8221;
</p>

TOM PICKED POLLY UP IN HIS ARMS.<br />
<i>Polly&#8217;s Business Venture.</i> <i>Page 200</i>
<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>Tom&#8217;s frown and the tone in which he declared
himself, made Polly want to laugh albeit she
shrunk away, somewhat, for fear of a plot in his
mind.
</p>
<p>Tom had, in his fervor, lost control once, but
he was too wise to indulge himself again, in such
a manner. Tom had spent a great deal of time
in studying, during the past year, the psychology
of love, and now he was going to test his knowledge.
He told John, just before he left the
ranch, that once a girl liked a fellow, it was easy
to make her love him, by judicious treatment. In
explanation, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;When Jeb wants to coax one of the burros to
the barn, he doesn&#8217;t give him the measure of oats
to eat out on the range&mdash;no, he leads the burro
to the barn by holding the box of feed ahead of
his nose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Brewsters laughed at Tom&#8217;s idea, but he
declared that that was the way he was going to
get Polly. And all their arguments about giving
Polly a chance to finish her studies and try out
her beloved work, fell on dull ears. Tom started
East!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, let&#8217;s all go to a good show, shall we?&#8221;
was Tom&#8217;s unexpected invitation, just as his companion
began to worry because he sat so close
beside her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Yes&mdash;I think that will be lovely!&#8221; said
Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Run up and tell the others to get
their caps and jackets on. I&#8217;ll telephone an agent
and see what&#8217;s good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly ran out of the room, glad to have the
problem of the evening&#8217;s entertainment solved for
her, but still she felt a little disappointed because
Tom could so eagerly suggest taking the family
out when she wanted to have a tête-à-tête with him
to ask about the mines. Tom&#8217;s plan about holding
the temptation before a burro instead of surfeiting
him with goodies, was evidently beginning
to work.
</p>
<p>The play was one of the most popular ones,
and seats were in great demand. But money does
anything in New York, so Tom secured splendid
orchestra seats, and they reached the theatre just
as the curtain went up on the first scene. The interior
was darkened when they entered, and Polly
could not tell who sat in front of her, until the
first act ended and the lights were turned on.
</p>
<p>Tom sat beside her, and began whispering in
his free western voice, when a young man seated
directly in front, turned deliberately around and
stared at him. Polly gasped, and Eleanor
nudged her in the side. It was Jack Baxter!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>Without taking his eyes from Tom, Jack
reached under the chair and got his hat. Then
he dragged his coat over his arm, and got up.
He bowed stiffly to the girls in Tom&#8217;s party, and
went out. Tom waited until he was gone, then
he looked down at Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um! It was high time I came East, I see!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; was Polly&#8217;s smiling rejoinder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By next Spring it might have been Tom who
sat alone and felt like the fifth wheel in a wagon
instead of Baxter. My, but I&#8217;m glad I came!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly frowned, and Eleanor did her best to hear
what was said between these two <i>apparently</i>
phlegmatic companions. But Tom meant his
words for Polly&#8217;s ears only.
</p>
<p>Once during the evening, when the light was
so low that the theatre was almost dark, Tom
changed his position in such a way that his arm
rested over the back of Polly&#8217;s chair. In his interest
in the scene on the stage, his hand dropped
carelessly upon her shoulder. And Polly was too
engaged with the play to remove it, or even
change her position to allow it to fall back again.
</p>
<p>Then Tom moved, so that his arms touched
hers, and his hand that rested upon one knee,
could cover Polly&#8217;s hand while the audience was
enthralled by the burglar&#8217;s escape, and no one but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Eleanor had the slightest idea of what was going
on in these two orchestra chairs. But Polly grew
restive and tried to free her hand.
</p>
<p>Then the lights went up again, and Tom moved
away and said apologetically: &#8220;These seats are
so cramped for such a great fellow as I am!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Polly replied tartly: &#8220;Yes, they really
ought to allow more room for people&#8217;s hands and
arms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor smiled wisely, and sent Tom a teasing
look.
</p>
<p>John Baxter did not come back to claim his
seat that evening, and the play ended without
Polly having given him another thought. Poor
Jack!
</p>
<p>After Tom reached New York, there seemed
very little time for Polly in which to hunt up
antiques in the country, or to attend sales that
were advertised at various places. Then Winter
weather set in, and that gave her the necessary
excuse that the automobile could not travel in
snow or mud.
</p>
<p>All but Tom and Polly thought that Tom&#8217;s
plot to win Polly from her chosen profession
seemed to be succeeding. But Tom felt that he
had not had much encouragement as yet; and
Polly was having a very nice time with an old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
friend she liked better than other young men,
without feeling unduly indebted for the pleasure.
</p>
<p>Although the Latimers lived uptown in New
York, they saw little of Tom during the first
weeks of his return to the City. He stopped at
a hotel not far from the Fabian&#8217;s place, and made
duty-calls on his father and mother at regular
intervals, but they understood what he came East
for, and they wished him all success.
</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, with a new pastime
planned by Tom, for each day. And most of
these pleasures included the other girls, as well
as Polly. So the enjoyment was general, and
Polly could not say that Tom tried to get her
company for himself, by leaving her friends out
of any fun.
</p>
<p>December came in, and the Christmas season
advanced, with Tom still leading a gay life and
escorting the girls to every pleasure or entertainment
they heard of; and Polly was still the kind
little &#8220;sister&#8221; to him in every way, but nothing
more.
</p>
<p>Tom had selected his Christmas gift for Polly,
but no one had been told about it. This he had
kept absolutely secret. The Christmas Holidays
came and all schools closed, so that the girls had
no studies to attend to, and no art work to prepare.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Jim Latimer and his chum Kenneth came
home from Yale for the two weeks&#8217; vacation, and
they immediately called on Polly and Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Tom saw how gladly Polly welcomed Jim and
Kenneth, and he began to wonder if she really
preferred a young boy&#8217;s society to his. Polly and
Jim were about the same age&mdash;not quite eighteen,
while he&mdash;Tom, was almost twenty-four. Such
a decrepit old age!
</p>
<p>The evening Jim planned to visit Polly and
take Kenneth along for Eleanor, Tom, to the surprise
of his parents, spent the entire evening with
them; but he was not very attentive to what his
mother said, nor did he seem over-pleased with
being at home.
</p>
<p>Jim and Kenneth were noisy, active young college
boys, and they furnished lots of fun that evening,
of the energetic, &#8220;center-rush&#8221; kind. But
Polly was relieved when they had said good-night
and were gone.
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed at the way Jim &#8220;rough-housed&#8221;
both girls when he tried to kiss them
good-night, and Polly indignantly told him he
would never be invited there again! Jim laughed
and caught hold of Polly to shake her for such a
threat, but he smacked her loudly on the lips,
instead.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>As the two girls went upstairs to retire, Polly
said: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure Jim wouldn&#8217;t have acted so silly
if his big brother had been here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor then added: &#8220;We have such lovely
evenings with Tom, that this sort of horse-play
gets on my nerves!&#8221; Then she slyly watched her
friend&#8217;s expression to try and read her mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why Tom never came in tonight?&#8221;
said Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack Baxter met me this afternoon, and he
says Tom goes uptown regularly, to see a girl.
Jack shadowed him and knows exactly where the
girl lives. But he didn&#8217;t say I must not tell you,&#8221;
said Eleanor, confidentially. Neither did she add
that she had heard the address of this &#8220;girl&#8221; and
knew it to be Tom&#8217;s home and mother.
</p>
<p>Polly flushed, but said nonchalantly: &#8220;Poor
Tom! He feels awfully bored with us girls, at
times!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think so! especially if he came home
for a visit with the idea of finding a nice girl to
propose to. Now Jack thinks that Tom, with
his good looks, his wonderful intelligence, and his
family-tree, to say nothing of the Latimer fortune,
ought to be able to take his pick of any New
York girl that is looking for an ideal husband,&#8221;
remarked Eleanor, guilelessly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Polly flashed her a look. &#8220;Since when has
Jack Baxter dropped his maligning of Tom Latimer,
and started to admire him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor bit her lips to prevent a smile, but she
replied, innocently: &#8220;Why, Jack always did admire
Tom, even when he met him at Pebbly Pit.
But he is jealous of him, for all the admiration
he has for him. But I&#8217;ll tell you, Polly: I
wouldn&#8217;t trust Jack in a case of &#8216;love or war.&#8217;
He&#8217;d as soon make Tom believe you were in love
with another man, as anything else, if he could
win a point by it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Eleanor over-stepped her ambition this
time. Polly quickly replied: &#8220;Then Jack must
be trying to &#8216;win a point&#8217; when he got you to tell
me that Tom was calling on another girl,
uptown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor realized her error and had common
sense enough not to endeavor to explain it away.
She merely said: &#8220;Oh well, Tom is too handsome
a fellow to be wandering about New York
these nights without a guardian. Some wide
awake girl is going to snap him up the first
chance!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me, Nolla, that Tom has been wandering
about since he arrived in the City, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
whole bevy of guardians to keep him from snares
and pitfalls. With all of us girls surrounding
him, a fine chance any other girl could have found
to snap him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor was evidently getting worsted in her
well-meant plan to further Tom&#8217;s case, so she
wisely decided to keep still.
</p>
<p>Nothing was heard from Tom the next day,
although Polly was sure he would call, or telephone,
before evening. Then the telephone did
ring, but it was Mr. Dalken, inviting the entire
family over to his apartment for a party that
evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just an impromptu affair, you know, with some
of our old friends coming in to spend the
evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian accepted for herself and husband,
and said she would see if the girls had any engagement.
She came back to the living-room
where they were waiting for dinner to be announced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you girls going out this evening, or have
you any engagement at home?&#8221; asked she.
</p>
<p>Nancy shook her head, and Eleanor replied:
&#8220;For a great wonder, we haven&#8217;t a blessed thing
on for tonight! First evening free in months!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dalken wants us to come over and join
some old friends, just for a nice visit,&#8221; ventured
Mrs. Fabian, looking from one girl to the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine! Anything but sitting here staring at
Polly&#8217;s concerned face,&#8221; retorted Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fabian smiled and went to answer Mr.
Dalken, but Polly sat up and asked Eleanor what
she meant by that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ask yourself, Polly, you&#8217;ve been mooning
around all day looking like &#8216;Gottschalk&#8217;s Last
Hope.&#8217; One speaks to you, and you never hear
what&#8217;s said. The very house could burn down
but you&#8217;d never know it. You&#8217;d roast without
feeling any sensation in it!&#8221; declared Eleanor,
impatiently. Nancy laughed at both girls.
</p>
<p>After dinner, while the girls were dressing to
go to Mr. Dalken&#8217;s, Eleanor went to Polly&#8217;s room
to be hooked up. When she saw Polly arrayed
in one of her most fetching Paris dresses she stood
and stared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! we&#8217;re not going to the Opera!&#8221; said
she.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to Mr. Dalken&#8217;s, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;
asked Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but Jack won&#8217;t be there&mdash;nor Tom,
either,&#8221; was Eleanor&#8217;s smooth reply.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of who might be there, I
dressed for my old friend, Mr. Dalken. He is
so correct in these matters, so I want to do justice
to his friendship,&#8221; Polly scored this time.
</p>
<p>Eleanor did not wait to be hooked up but rushed
back to her own room, and when Polly met her
again, down in the hall, she had changed her gown,
also, and looked very attractive, indeed.
</p>
<p>Because of the delay occasioned by Eleanor,
the Fabian party was late in reaching Mr. Dalken&#8217;s.
The other guests were already there, and
to Polly&#8217;s intense gratification, not only was Jack
assisting the host for the evening, but Tom sat
in one corner of the large living room, looking
at a book of snap-shots taken by Mr. Dalken
while out in the Rockies. So engrossed was Tom
in the pictures, that he did not lift his head when
new-comers were welcomed.
</p>
<p>Polly glanced over at the corner and finding
Tom so interested in mountain charms, while female
charms abounded so near him, she felt
peeved and smiled radiantly on Jack. Eleanor
saw, and determined that she would not permit
matters to go astray again, as she had taken such
trouble to get Mr. Dalken to plan this impromptu
gathering just to give Polly the opportunity to see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
both suitors together&mdash;to the advancement of one
or the other&#8217;s interest. Eleanor had no doubt
that it would be Tom&#8217;s advancement.
</p>
<p>So she flirted outrageously with Jack, to the
amusement of Mr. Dalken who understood how
matters were with all the young people. Thus
Eleanor was cozily cornered with Jack in the den,
doing her utmost to make him forget Polly for
the time being, when the Jap came to the living-room
door and announced a new caller.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>NECESSARY EXPLANATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Eleanor was not to be seen when a young man
came in the room and was joyously welcomed by
everyone present. Tom Latimer had disappeared
also, a short time before this, and Polly
was sitting in the wide seat built in the window,
staring out over the roofs of the buildings without
seeing a thing.
</p>
<p>The delighted exclamations from those in the
room, however, drew her attention, and she was
rejoiced to see Paul Stewart shaking hands with
those crowding about him. So Polly left her
shadowy retreat and ran over to welcome him,
too.
</p>
<p>Paul was saying: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too jolly of John to
send me East for the Holidays, by making me
power-of-attorney for the Stock-holders meeting
the first of January. That was the only way I
could have come&mdash;by having my fare paid!&#8221; Paul
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
laughed because they all knew of his financial
problems, and how he was striving to win success
that he might propose to Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Polly felt annoyed because she was sure Eleanor
had led Tom to the den that she might advise
him further in his love-affairs. And it was this
interference by Eleanor, that roused much of
Polly&#8217;s indifference or impatience towards Tom.
Now she felt she had been given a good opportunity
to square accounts with her chum.
</p>
<p>Paul and she were standing alone for a moment,
when she saw him looking about for someone.
She gave the desired cue: &#8220;You&#8217;ll find Nolla with
Tom, enjoying a tête-à-tête in Mr. Dalken&#8217;s little
den across the hallway, Paul.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As she watched Paul hurriedly excuse himself,
she experienced a new sensation&mdash;that of gratified
revenge on a friend. She walked about the
room, apparently looking at the pictures, but really
to reach the hall without attracting attention.
Once she got out of the room, she made a dash for
a shadowy corner made by an old ormolu secretaire
between the two doors. She could see into
the den and watch Paul&#8217;s next action.
</p>
<p>Two huge Turkish chairs were drawn up before
the fire-place but the electric lights were out
and only the candles on the tables near the door
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
were lighted. The leaping flames of the logs
burning in the fire-place threw dancing shadows
over the two occupants of the chairs, but anyone
standing near the door could not see who these
occupants were.
</p>
<p>Paul crept stealthily over to the chairs, planning
to surprise his two old friends&mdash;believing Tom to
be one, and Eleanor the other. He lifted his
hands with the intention of clapping them over
Eleanor&#8217;s eyes to make her guess who was there,
when he heard words that rooted him to the spot.
Polly saw but could not hear, so she lost the best
part of her retaliation on Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Just as Paul was about to bring down his palms
over Eleanor&#8217;s eyes, a strange voice murmured
intensely: &#8220;You know how I feel about it, Nolla.
This love is so absorbing that I cannot give my
attention to studies, or to any other important
matter. If I am treated to second place, now
that another lover is at hand, I will clear out of
New York and never be heard from again. In
fact, I am going to purposely throw myself in the
way of danger and end it all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paul realized that another man had found his
treasure and had been encouraged, or why should
he be saying &#8220;given second-place now that another
lover is at hand?&#8221; And it was evident that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
someone knew of his, Paul&#8217;s, proposed visit, as
<i>this</i> young man knew of his coming to see Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Such is the mortal&#8217;s egotism! One never thinks
of others in connection with a selfish hope or
idea, but believes that anything seen or heard
must appertain to that one thing. So Paul
thought Eleanor was the love this young man referred
to, and that she had given him second-place
because of Paul&#8217;s coming.
</p>
<p>These thoughts flitted through his mind as
young Baxter concluded, and Eleanor waited a
moment before answering. Then she said with
a sigh: &#8220;Dear Jack, a mild little flirtation never
hurt any real case of love, and I&#8217;ve told you many
times, that a game of love like this would improve
or become fatal, because of such a flirtation.
Like anti-toxin&mdash;it <i>kills</i> the germs or makes them
wild so that no further doubt remains about the
patient. Let&#8217;s use the hypodermic courageously
and watch results. If the love-germ dies, then go
and throw yourself on the railroad track and end
your troubles. But should the opposite effect result,
you can always think of me as the specialist
who advised the heroic treatment!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paul was shocked to hear his &#8220;angel-girl&#8221; talk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
of her love in such a dreadfully frank way, but the
suitor&#8217;s next sentence left no doubt in Paul&#8217;s mind
that Eleanor was a horrid flirt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Nolla, you must know best. Paul has
been in love with you for a long time, now, and
you&#8217;ve had many young admirers since you came
to New York; so you understand and appreciate
my present position and my right to demand one
thing or the other&mdash;either <i>I</i> am the accepted one,
or the other man. Both of us cannot be kept
dangling about, nor take turns in loving when the
other is absent from New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paul was distressed at hearing this&mdash;that
Eleanor could accept the attentions of other men
when he, Paul, was so hard at work out West,
trying to succeed in his profession that he might
offer her a suitable home! Now she was flirting
with others, and this young man was heart-broken
over her short-comings, even as he, Paul, was.
</p>
<p>Polly saw Paul wheel and rush from the room,
and immediately after that, Eleanor and Jack
jumped up from the chairs and gazed at the door
where the intruder had disappeared. When
Polly saw who Eleanor&#8217;s companion was, she
gasped in astonishment, for she believed it was
Tom sitting before the fire.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>Had Polly hurried after Paul, to explain matters
to him, all would have ended well that evening,
but she went to the room where her wraps
had been left and sat down to think out the problem.
Meantime, Paul found Mr. Dalken and
drew him aside to say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask questions, and don&#8217;t try to stop me,
but I am going away as quick as I can. I&#8217;m
through with girls for all time. They&#8217;re not to
be trusted when a man&#8217;s absent. I&#8217;m going to
live for my mother, hereafter, and make her life
happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken was taken by surprise, because he
had no key to this new puzzle, but he said: &#8220;Do
wait, my boy, and have some refreshments with us.
I have so much to ask you about the mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no! I can&#8217;t stay. The mine isn&#8217;t my
affair anyway, and I was a fool to coax John to
give me power-of-attorney to come East for him.
Now I&#8217;m rushing back and he can send Tom Latimer
the affidavit necessary for the meeting in
January.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now, Paul! You are a hot-headed
young fellow and I feel sure matters can be explained
quickly, if you will but wait!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Paul scowled and stiffened his spine as he replied:
&#8220;Mr. Dalken, I heard with my own ears,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
that Nolla is infatuated with another young man.
She said, <i>and I</i> heard her say it: &#8216;She was not certain
which one of us she preferred but the test
would show if she used a good dose of anti-toxin
to help the germ! But I&#8217;m no &#8216;second fiddle&#8217; even
if that other fellow is! If a girl can&#8217;t tell whether
she loves me without using hypodermics to help
her find out, then she&#8217;s no wife for me! Maybe
I&#8217;m a wild and woolly westerner from Denver,
but believe me! we westerners never stand around
waiting for a bit to be forced between our
teeth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken could hardly restrain his sudden
desire to laugh, but he averted his head for a
moment and covered his face with a handkerchief
until he composed his risibles, then he said: &#8220;Still,
I am sure I can mediate in this case, Paul. Only
stay and let me inquire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not! No one can mediate between
me and a flirt! I am through, I say, and I&#8217;m
going home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So saying Paul thrust out his hand and Mr.
Dalken had to take it. &#8220;Good-by, and say good-by
to the others for me. This much I want you
to do, as I will not see them again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken went to the door with his excited
guest and saw him go down on the elevator, then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
he rushed madly back to the telephone and ordered
the man to detain the departing guest. Back to
the den where he had seen Eleanor standing with
Jack, was his next act, and dragging both out of
the apartment and along the hall to the elevator,
he pushed the button furiously.
</p>
<p>While the wondering attendant was coming up,
Mr. Dalken said: &#8220;What in the name of conscience
did you two crazy creatures do or say to Paul
Stewart, to drive him frantic?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack stared in ignorance of what his guardian
meant, but Eleanor gazed as if she thought Mr.
Dalken had suddenly gone mad. The elevator
stopped at their floor, and the man opened the
gate. Mr. Dalken pulled his two companions on,
and the man started down again.
</p>
<p>All this time, Eleanor was speechless with doubt
of Mr. Dalken&#8217;s sanity but the elevator man
turned to him and said: &#8220;The young man I just
took down, refused to remain. He said he would
arrest anyone who tried to detain him against his
will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken ran his hands through his hair and
rolled his eyes upward. Turning to Eleanor he
hissed: &#8220;What <i>did</i> you say to Paul to make him
act like a man in torment?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Paul! Are you crazy, Mr. Dalken?&#8221; asked
Eleanor, fearfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but <i>you</i> must be to throw over such a
sweetheart. You&#8217;ll wait a long time before you
get another like him, even though I do like Jack
immensely, and will further his case when he meets
the right girl. I&#8217;m sure you are not the right one,
and you ought to know it, from what you told me
yourself, yesterday. Can&#8217;t you see that Jack
thinks he loves Polly, just because she won&#8217;t have
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I understand!&#8221; retorted Eleanor,
but annoyed that her plot to bring Polly and Tom
together again was exposed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why in the name of heavens did you send
Paul away believing it was <i>you</i> that Jack wanted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before an answer could be given, the elevator
reached the ground floor and the man quickly
opened the doors. Out in the vestibule the telephone-operator
was button-holing a young man
and using every persuasion to detain him.
</p>
<p>Jack Baxter had never seen Paul so he did not
recognize him now. But Eleanor did, and she
stood stock-still in such surprise that Mr. Dalken
ran ahead without her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul, Paul! I knew you had made a mistake.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Eleanor is here to explain everything,&#8221; said he,
taking the place of the amazed servant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can she explain that will change my
opinion of her?&#8221; scorned Paul, sending a cold
look at poor Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla, come here, Paul wants you to explain,&#8221;
begged Mr. Dalken, beside himself.
</p>
<p>Her first surprise at finding Paul Stewart in
New York <i>and in the house</i>, passed over and
Eleanor forgot Jack and everything else, as she
rushed forward to welcome her old sweetheart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul&mdash;Oh Paul! When did <i>you</i> come?&#8221;
cried she.
</p>
<p>But Paul&#8217;s haughty stare stopped her when she
was not ten inches from him. He turned to Mr.
Dalken and said: &#8220;Now that you&#8217;ve broken your
word with me, you had best explain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> broken my word! I never gave my word
to anything that is broken. Remember, Paul,
you may be a hot-headed impulsive youth, but you
cannot make such sweeping accusations without
grounds for them. I am so sorry for you in your
disappointment that I will excuse you this time,
however, and explain for your benefit, that I
caught hold of Jack and Nolla after you left and
dragged them down here without &#8216;breaking my
word&#8217; as you claim, or any other unhonorable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
deed. Unless you consider getting at the truth
is unprincipled.&#8221; Mr. Dalken was stern and dignified
in his self-justification, and Paul had the
grace to flush uncomfortably.
</p>
<p>Eleanor was standing, uncertain of what was
best to do in this strange meeting. She had felt
over-joyed a moment before, to find Paul there,
but now she wondered why he was so angry, and
why he had not waited to greet her, as long as
he had been up in the apartment. Baxter, not
feeling at home in this group, turned and asked
the man to take him up again.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken had not seen Jack leave again, so
he turned to call him, but found he had disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla, what did you say to Paul when he met
you?&#8221; demanded the older man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Why, Mr. Dalken, I never knew Paul
was here. The first hint I had of something unusual
was when you rushed in to drag us downstairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken was puzzled so he turned to Paul.
&#8220;Then why did you say Nolla was a flirt and had
made a fool of you? I thought she met you and
began to tease, as she does everyone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no need of her saying anything to
me, as I heard her tell, when she was not aware
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
of my standing behind her chair, that the young
man she was with might prove to be the accepted
love after all.&#8221; Then Paul repeated the substance
of the talk he had overheard between Jack
and Eleanor.
</p>
<p>As he concluded, Eleanor laughed hysterically
and held out her hands to Mr. Dalken beseechingly.
&#8220;Oh, dear Dalky! Can&#8217;t you see how
Paul misunderstood everything! I was speaking
of Jack&#8217;s case with Polly, and advising him in regard
to Tom. I know Jack is not seriously in
love with Polly, but he fancies himself so, because
Polly is so attractive and indifferent to him. As
Jack has always been flattered and made love to
by society girls, this unexpected attitude of Polly&#8217;s
piqued the boy. I did my best tonight, to show
all three of these silly young things where they
stood in this serious matter. And <i>to think</i>, I got
myself in hot water for trying to help my
friends!&#8221; Eleanor unexpectedly broke out in
sobs and leaned her head against Mr. Dalken&#8217;s
shoulder.
</p>
<p>Paul began to accuse himself for being a brute,
and Mr. Dalken patted Eleanor&#8217;s head and said
comfortingly: &#8220;Never mind, Nolla dear. You&#8217;ll
learn by bitter experience that the more one interferes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
in these love tangles for the sake of helping
friends out of their troubles, the more our
friends detest us and we end in falling into snares
ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&mdash;don&#8217;t I know it now!&#8221; wept Eleanor,
in a muffled voice, because her mouth was hard
against her comforter&#8217;s coat.
</p>
<p>Paul stood uncertain of what to say or do. He
shifted his weight from one foot to the other,
and glanced around, but always brought his
wandering eyes back to Eleanor&#8217;s shaking
form.
</p>
<p>An interruption, in shape of the entrance of
some merry tenants of another apartment, suddenly
caused Mr. Dalken to lift Eleanor&#8217;s head
and hurry her, with Paul, into the reception room
at one end of the main hall. Here they sat down
to have an understanding.
</p>
<p>When the facts were fully revealed, Paul was
as grateful to Mr. Dalken for restraining him in
his plans to run away, as Eleanor was for his
hasty removal of her from upstairs, to the hall
downstairs. And poor Mr. Dalken was <i>most</i>
grateful to find he had made peace between two
disturbed young hearts. He got up and said:
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope you won&#8217;t curse me in the future, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
this reconciliation. And for goodness&#8217; sake!
Let me get upstairs to my guests, and help Taki
serve refreshments, or the oysters will be ruined
with stewing, while the wonderful French patties
I got from Del&#8217;s, will be cold and clammy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed, and beckoned Paul to come
up again. So the grinning elevator man carried
them up and very considerately accepted the tip
Paul slipped into his palm as he stepped from
the lift.
</p>
<p>The Japanese butler had not waited for Mr.
Dalken, however, and was passing the famous
patties and sandwiches when the three absent
members of the party entered again, and tried to
act as if nothing unusual had happened.
</p>
<p>Polly had witnessed Paul&#8217;s flying departure,
and thereafter saw Jack and Eleanor astounded
in the darkened library. When Mr. Dalken
rushed in and dragged them both away, Polly
stood open-mouthed and stared after them. The
Jap wisely hurried forward and carefully closed
the front door, then went back to his duties without
showing that he had seen the queer performances
of his master, or found Polly standing
there, the single witness of the scene.
</p>
<p>Polly still stood in the hall deeply perplexed,
when Tom sauntered from Mr. Dalken&#8217;s bedroom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
where he had been smoking a cigarette to
steady his nerves. Now he joined Polly and began
a conventional phrase, but was suddenly interrupted
by her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does all this silly behavior mean?&#8221; demanded
she.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you refer to my behavior?&#8221; asked Tom,
blandly.
</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s eyes snapped. &#8220;Of course not! Must
you always think yourself first and foremost?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As this was an unexpected and undeserved slap
for Tom, he was still groping for a clue, when
Polly&#8217;s angry impatience with herself for having
made such a blunder in her calculations about
Eleanor and the others, made her exclaim:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can plainly see that Nolla will never
make any sort of a business partner for me! Her
foolish head is so turned by beaus, that she will
never settle down until Paul has either spurned
her love, or she is married and divorced again.
<i>Then</i> there may be hopes of her attending to our
work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Tom was not aware of Paul&#8217;s sudden appearance
and hasty departure, he still pondered
what was best to say to Polly, in her unusual pettish
mood. But she paid no heed to his silence
and continued, like most women will when they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
have been mistaken, and fear the consequences of
an ill-advised step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare! if Paul does come back and makes
up with Nolla, I shall move heaven and earth
to see that they are safely engaged this time!
And that Jack Baxter, well, I&#8217;ll make Dalky ship
him off to some distant college so there&#8217;ll be no
further wasting of valuable time with him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This last declaration so over-joyed Tom that
he found courage to offer a suggestion. But he
was too unwise this time. &#8220;You&#8217;re absolutely
right, Polly dear. That Baxter has nothing better
to do than kill time. He never did a stroke
of work in his life, nor did his father before him.
Those young &#8216;lady&#8217;s men&#8217; who live on their ancestor&#8217;s
rewards of labor, never amount to a row
of beans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly stared freezingly at Tom, but he was
completely mesmerized with the romantic picture
he was presenting, and so he continued oblivious
of his companion&#8217;s expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll send Baxter flying, after this, and help
poor Paul to hold his place with Nolla. I&#8217;ll wire
Paul to fix it so he can come East for Christmas,
and surprise Nolla. Then we&#8217;ll all announce a
double engagement, eh?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
Tom turned to watch Polly&#8217;s face as she surely
must second his plan, but he changed his mind
when he saw her frown. &#8220;As usual, Tom, you&#8217;re
much too late in your brilliant ideas. Others are
ahead of you. Paul has been here tonight and
gone again, and Nolla will never have any engagement
to announce&mdash;if she waits for Paul&#8217;s
declaration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As for <i>me</i>! My announcements are being
engraved now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom caught his breath in consternation at this
news. &#8220;Your announcements, Polly! <i>Oh</i>, and
you jilted me, after all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly enjoyed turning the knife in the wound,
because she felt so wretched herself for having
ruined Eleanor&#8217;s happiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not jilt anyone who never proposed,
could I? I have maintained for a long time, and
everyone who knows me is aware of it, too&mdash;that
I am engaged to my profession and I have ordered
my announcements to that effect. I propose
sending out my business cards the first week
of January!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The relief to Tom was so great that he sighed
aloud: &#8220;Oh, thank heavens for that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you would be glad, Tom; so you see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
you are sensible after all, and can thank heaven
that you had no cause to be jilted!&#8221; laughed Polly,
maliciously, but she felt no satisfaction in this outcome
of her understanding with Tom.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>MUTUAL CONSOLATION</h3>
</div>

<p>It was at this point in Polly&#8217;s independent
speech that the door opened and Mr. Dalken
came in with his two repentant lovers. Tom
saw that the clouds had been dispersed and now
there seemed to be a clear sky for Paul. But he
was curious to hear what had happened during
the short time he had been smoking that cigarette.
</p>
<p>Polly also saw Paul return with Nolla, and
when she saw the happy smiles on both faces, she
groaned, and turned to go to the library where,
so little time before, the tragic lover had escaped
with a determination to never look at another
girl as long as he lived&mdash;excepting his mother.
</p>
<p>Tom followed Mr. Dalken to the dining-room
to learn the particulars about the two individuals
who had meekly followed the host back to the
apartment; while Polly sank down in one of the
Turkish arm-chairs recently occupied by the two
plotting match-makers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>Mr. Dalken rolled his eyes ceiling-ward and
complained: &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand why I should
be chosen by Providence to act as peace-maker
between jealous lovers, or quarrelsome husbands
and wives. It is one of the most thankless jobs
a man can have.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom laughed in spite of his eagerness to be
told the details. &#8220;Maybe it is because you have
so much <i>feeling</i> for heartsick mortals,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken looked serious. &#8220;Yes, Tom my
boy, you spoke the truth there. If anyone knows
the misery caused by fools and faithlessness, I&#8217;m
that one. Perhaps that is the reason I can mediate
for my friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to ask you to mediate for me, with
Polly, but I haven&#8217;t the heart to ask you, now,&#8221;
ventured Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you big ninny, I&#8217;ve done nothing else
but try to mediate between you two for the past
two years. If matters haven&#8217;t reached a crisis
by this time, I&#8217;d better give up the case and let
you get a specialist,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Dalken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me exactly where I stand now, and I&#8217;ll
excuse you from further annoyance on my part.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott, Man! Can&#8217;t you tell where you
stand? How can <i>I</i> judge. You surely don&#8217;t
want me to propose for you, do you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>Tom couldn&#8217;t afford to feel indignant, as he had
to ask his friend what had happened to Paul and
Eleanor, during his temporary absence from the
others. So Mr. Dalken told as much of the story
as he had been able to understand, concluding
with the admonition: &#8220;Now that Jack can&#8217;t wile
away time with Nolla, he will, doubtless, turn his
full attention to Polly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was the only malicious remark the poor
man permitted himself to indulge in. But Tom
took it seriously and said: &#8220;Thanks awfully, for
the hint. I&#8217;ll keep after Polly myself, until Baxter
gives up the chase.&#8221; And with that he hurried
away to find Polly.
</p>
<p>He found Paul and Eleanor sitting in the deep
window-seat where Polly had been the early part
of the evening, and as he wandered about for a
glimpse of his &#8220;Heart&#8217;s Desire,&#8221; the Jap came
over with a tray and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mis&#8217;r Tom look fer supper? Taki keep nice
patty for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack Baxter was near enough to hear Taki,
and he laughed jeeringly as he said: &#8220;Oh, what
a fine man you are, Taki! You know exactly
what your master&#8217;s guests are wanting&mdash;patties
or Pollies!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Taki grinned but failed to grasp the young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
man&#8217;s meaning. Tom did, however, and leaving
the oyster patty on the tray, he stalked across to
Jack and said, threateningly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you speak like that? Mentioning
Miss Brewster&#8217;s name in the same breath as an
oyster patty or a poll-parrot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the truth of the matter was, Jack had never
meant to convey the meaning, when he said &#8220;Pollies,&#8221;
that he spoke of parrots. So he instantly
took the stand of the offended one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you even hint at such an insult to
a friend of mine? I consider Miss Brewster too
far above either you or me to discuss her with
you, about such matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wise Taki had disappeared quickly and in another
moment the harassed host came hurrying
from the serving board. He glowered upon
Tom and Jack, and grasping each one by the arm,
he hustled them out into the main hall of the
building and then spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You two bullies go down in the street and
fight it out. I&#8217;ll do you the favor to ring up the
police station and call a cop to come around and
take you both in custody&mdash;that&#8217;s where you belong,
until you come to your senses. If <i>I</i> were a
girl I&#8217;d never look at either of you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But this advice cooled their anger, and the moment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
Mr. Dalken turned to go back to his apartment
both men laughed at the situation. Tom offered
his hand and Baxter shook it. Then each
apologised to the other, and in a few minutes
they started for the door of the apartment.
</p>
<p>But the door was locked, and, in front of it on
the mat, were two small heaps: one was composed
of Tom&#8217;s coat and hat, with a patty and
sandwich on a wooden plate, on top of it. The
other small heap was Jack&#8217;s dress-cape, with his
silk hat topping it, and in the hat, were his gloves
and the plate with refreshments. His cane hung
on the door-knob.
</p>
<p>All the bell-ringing Tom indulged in, thereafter,
failed to bring any answer. So the two
young men, highly amused by their host&#8217;s farewell
act, ate the scanty refreshments handed out, and
then left the two wooden plates in front of the
door, with a note on each. The pencilled scrawls
said: &#8220;Two hungry beggars thank the rich man
who threw them the crumbs from his table.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After they had gone down to the ground floor,
Jack said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to get Dalken on the telephone
and ask him to send us down enough company
to keep us from going to sleep in the reception
room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom laughed and stood eagerly waiting to hear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the reply. But the operator smiled and reported:
&#8220;Mr. Dalken called down a few minutes ago, and
said that he was not at home to anyone&mdash;not even
to friends&mdash;until tomorrow morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the two chagrined young men left, and
whatever they did during the next few hours, no
one ever knew, but from that evening both forgot
their rivalry and became fast friends. Jack suddenly
decided to go West and finish his engineering
studies in the mountains about Pebbly Pit.
And Tom decided to make one last stand for
Polly, and should she still refuse him on the basis
that she must finish a business experience first,
then he would knuckle down to hard work and
forget all about her, forever.
</p>
<p>It was easier for Jack to carry out his purpose
than for Tom to leave New York and forget
Polly. But Jack managed to do as he had outlined,
and before Christmas Day he had said
good-by and was on his way to Denver.
</p>
<p>Tom spent so much time and preparation before
the mirror in his room, perfecting himself
in the art of proposing to Polly, in such a way
that she would be impressed, that he became quite
self-conscious of his pose and words. On Christmas
Day, he planned to coax her away by herself,
and then fall upon his knees and tell his story.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
He had a magnificent solitaire in his pocket, waiting
to be displayed at the right moment.
</p>
<p>No one saw Tom all that Christmas morning,
although his friends called on the telephone, both
at his home and at the hotel. He did not reply
to any calls. But late in the afternoon he sauntered
forth from his room, looking more like a
silly dandy than a big sensible young man who
was one of the best engineers in the West.
</p>
<p>He got in a taxi and gave directions. In front
of Mr. Fabian&#8217;s house, he paid the driver and
went up the steps. After he had rung the bell,
he felt in his pocket to make sure the ring-box
was there. This was about the twentieth time he
had assured himself.
</p>
<p>The maid opened the door, and looked sorry
for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Polly? Are the ladies in?&#8221; stammered
Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m&mdash;no-sir, I mean,&#8221; returned the maid,
confused at his certainty of finding them at home.
&#8220;They went out an hour ago, after tryin&#8217; to get
you on the &#8217;phone. They says they won&#8217;t be back
till after midnight, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they say where they were going?&#8221; asked
Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m&mdash;No-sir! But I hear&#8217;n Miss Polly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
talk to someone on the &#8217;phone and she says: &#8216;Oh
how lovely! We&#8217;ll all go with you. And we&#8217;ll
meet you there for dinner,&#8217;&#8221; repeated the maid.
&#8220;You see, I was openin&#8217; th&#8217; door to take more
presents for the young ladies, so I hear&#8217;n that
much of the talk from the table &#8217;phone in the back
hall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom thanked her with a sinking heart, and
turned away. Once more his fingers mechanically
felt for the ring box but he experienced no thrill
this time, when he found it was safe.
</p>
<p>He walked slowly cross-town and recklessly
passed over Broadway with its traffic in full swing,
looking neither to the right nor to the left. The
officer shouted to rouse him from his apathy, but
it failed to work.
</p>
<p>He reached the park and found a bench.
There he sat down without looking at the seat.
A frantic boy ran over and yelled: &#8220;Get up,
mister! Get up&mdash;you&#8217;se sittin&#8217; on my Chrismus
candy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom got up as mechanically as an automaton,
but a few of the gummy candies clung to his
coat-tails, while the boy fearful of losing such
treasure ran after the man to pick off the sticky
sweets.
</p>
<p>When he found another bench that was clear,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
and no boys nearby to worry his soul, Tom sat
down and sulked. Having practised so faithfully
all that day, in adding the finishing touches of
grace to his lesson of proposing, it was a bitter
dose to find all his work was wasted. Polly had
joyfully accepted someone else&#8217;s invitation to go
away and have a good time, leaving him alone
and heart-broken.
</p>
<p>Sleet and drizzle began falling, and Tom was
soon soaked through, but he was heedless of clinging
clothes and wet shoes.
</p>
<p>After an hour of self-pity, he got up and started
down the drive. By this time he was almost
frozen, but he congratulated himself on the fact
that he might have pneumonia and die. Then
Polly might feel sorry for her coldness!
</p>
<p>Following the suggestion this idea presented,
Tom wilfully waded through the slush in the gutters,
and thoroughly drenched his patent-leather
shoes in crossing the streets, until his feet were
not only wet but freezing inside the shoes.
</p>
<p>He found a cheap restaurant where the show-windows
displayed baskets of artificial fruit; and
as a center-piece of this decoration, there was a
great block of ice holding up a dressed goose,
with red holly twined about it.
</p>
<p>Tom detested quick-lunch places where the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
steam satisfied a man&#8217;s hunger, the moment he
came in contact with its heavy odors, but he reveled
in this evening&#8217;s opportunity to be a martyr,
so he sat down and ordered corn-beef and cabbage
because he loathed it.
</p>
<p>Although he could not eat much of the delectable
dish he had ordered, he was determined to
finish his day accordingly. So he ordered
Neapolitan ice-cream and coffee. The ice-cream
was served with the tissue paper still wrapped
about the cake&mdash;to prove that no hands had been
in contact with the dessert before serving it. But
the highly colored stripes of the soapy cream that
refused to melt, even when he dropped a spoonful
into his oily coffee, cured him of further martyrdom
to the cause of love.
</p>
<p>He hastily got up from the table, paid his ticket
and ran out. By this time, he felt so sick and
chilled that he gloated in the assurance that soon
he would be in a raging fever. He pictured
Polly&#8217;s regrets when she should return home at
midnight and hear that he had been taken to a
hospital, with a fatal case of double pneumonia.
He had decided on having it double, after he left
the restaurant, as that would kill him sooner. In
this state of mind he had to dodge a taxi and
slipped to fall into a mud puddle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>But Tom could not resist the desire to see his
mother once more, before he died; and after
fighting off this inclination for another hour or
two, he was feeling so perfectly awful, that he
knew his last call had come for him.
</p>
<p>He had been sneezing every few minutes for
the past hour, and his eyes were running like twin
rivers. His nose was so stuffy that he could
hardly enunciate the words, when he told a
cabby to &#8220;Ta-ge me to sig siggy-sig West End
Avenoo.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the short time he was in the cab, he
could not breathe, and he had to keep his mouth
open to be able to inhale any air at all. He paid
off the taxi, and went to his mother&#8217;s apartment.
Before he could change his mind about calling,
he had pushed the bell-button.
</p>
<p>He heard someone coming down the hall, and
at the same time a door in front opened and the
laughter and noise of many merry voices reached
him as he stood waiting on the doormat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Mr. Tom&mdash;a merry Christmas,&#8221;
said the maid, smilingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goo&#8217; ebeneeg, Kadrina,&#8221; mumbled Tom,
scowling as he looked towards the front room
whence came the merry-making.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217; dell anyone I&#8217;m here, but dell Modder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
I&#8217;m sig and wand do see her ride away,&#8221; explained
Tom, snuffingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got a bad cold in your nose, ain&#8217;t chew?&#8221;
said Katrina, sympathetically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; shouted Tom, furiously. &#8220;I god&#8217;da
case ob double pneumonia!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Katrina jumped at the unexpected shout, and
hurried to the front room to call her mistress.
Instead of remembering to keep Tom&#8217;s presence
a secret, she whispered loud enough for Polly to
hear:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Tom jus&#8217; come in an&#8217; his nose is red as a
beet. His eyes is runnin&#8217;, too, an&#8217; he needs a atmosizer
to blow in his head, to clear out the snuffles
so&#8217;s he kin open his lungs, widdout keepin&#8217;
his mouth open all th&#8217; time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Instead of fainting with horror as Tom had
pictured she might, Polly laughed at Katrina&#8217;s
description, and Mrs. Latimer smiled and turned
to her guests to excuse herself, by saying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom just came in, poor boy, with a stuffy cold
in his head. I&#8217;ll put his feet in mustard and see
that he drinks a hot glass of doctored lemonade,
then I&#8217;ll be back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Tom, instead of bidding his mother an eternal
farewell and dying alone and abandoned, as
he had planned, in a hospital ward, was soon made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
to scald his feet in hot mustard water, while his
mother&#8217;s flannel kimono replaced his bedraggled
clothing, and a heavy blanket was wrapped about
him, and he was offered a nasty drink of lemonade,
but what else was in it other than lemon only
his mother knew!
</p>
<p>By this time he felt so wretched that he cared
nothing for solitaires or fiancées; all he wanted
was to get one good long breath through his nose
once more before he choked to death.
</p>
<p>His mother had returned to the merry-making
in the parlors, and Tom sat huddled in his unbecoming
bedding in his mother&#8217;s dressing-room.
Every few minutes he had to use Katrina&#8217;s &#8220;atmosizer&#8221;
for his nose, or gasp for breath.
</p>
<p>Just as the perspiration began to pour out of
every pore, and his feet felt like scalded lobsters,
and the vaseline his mother had smeared in his
eyes and over his nose, to void any chaffing, had
been trickled all over his face, Polly tiptoed into
the room that opened to the dressing-room where
he sat.
</p>
<p>He held his breath, fearing lest she hear him
gasp and find him in this awful predicament. He
could not see her after she closed the hall-door,
but he wondered what she was doing. At this
moment, a tickling in his nose began and he knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
it portended a sneeze! He must prevent it, or
Polly would track him down. If she ever saw
him in this condition, after all his hard study to
propose gracefully, he would take poison!
</p>
<p>But the sneeze was imperative, and it burst
forth in such an explosion, that Polly screamed
faintly from just behind the door of the little
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go&#8217;way! I won&#8217;d see anyone,&#8221; commanded
Tom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll let me come and see how you are,
won&#8217;t you, Tom dear?&#8221; coaxed Polly, appearing
at the open door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! You above everyone. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to a
hozpidal as zoon ads the ambulance gomes, and
I never wand to zee any ob my frien&#8217;z again. I&#8217;ll
leave word no one ids to gome to my funeral,
eider.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, dearest, don&#8217;t talk like that! Where
have you been today, to catch such an awful cold
in your head?&#8221; said Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Id&#8217;z my lungz, I dell you! Double pneumonia.
Leabe me to my fade, and forged me,
Polly!&#8221; tears rose in his eyes at this pitiful picture
of his lonely demise.
</p>
<p>But Polly was practical, and stubborn to a degree.
She refused to go, and when Mrs. Latimer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
came back, she told her that Tom ought to be in
bed and given a great big dose of quinine&mdash;then
he&#8217;d be all right in the morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what we planned to do, Polly,&#8221;
said Mrs. Latimer. &#8220;I sent Katrina to the drugstore
for the pills, just now. But you run back
and enjoy yourself, dear, as you can do nothing
for Tom. He&#8217;s like all men&mdash;as grouchy as a
bear with a sore head, the minute anything ails
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His mother laughed, and Polly stood smiling.
Tom fumed. &#8220;Was this all the sympathy he was
to win for his self-appointed martyrdom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just as he had lost the last vestige of hope in
life, Polly said to his mother: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen
Tom before, today, to wish him a merry Christmas
and to give him my present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; ejaculated Mrs. Latimer, wisely, and
slipped from the room, closing the hall door very
quietly after her.
</p>
<p>Tom opened one eye and began to wonder if it
was worth while&mdash;this living business? When
Polly smiled so angelically upon him, in spite of
his ludicrous pose and appearance, he thought he
might make one more trial of temporal existence.
</p>
<p>Then Polly said, &#8220;I am sorry I could not reach
you by telephone today, Tom. I had a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
surprise for you, that I&#8217;m sure you will like. Shall
I show you now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it ids egsadtly wha&#8217;d I wads plannig to
ags you?&#8221; said Tom, sitting up with interest, and
forgetting the tub of hot water with his feet
slowly par-boiling in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is. Isn&#8217;t it neat and business-like?&#8221;
said Polly, as she handed him a small paste-board
card.
</p>
<p>Tom read:
</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;POLLY BREWSTER</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Decorator</span></p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>New York City</span></p>
<p><i>Representing Ashby Shops, New York and London</i>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Tom&#8217;s shocked surprise at the unexpected announcement,
so different from what he had expected,
rendered him speechless for a full minute.
During this pause, Polly patted his damp hair just
as she might have patted her brother John&#8217;s head,
or a faithful Newfoundland&#8217;s shaggy dome.
This latter was Tom&#8217;s thought.
</p>
<p>The gentle touch, combined with his resentful
feelings about the business announcement, made
him lose all self-control. He was so furious that
he could not find his voice, and if he had, his
words would have been unintelligible because of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
the head-cold. He sprang up from the chair,
forgetful of his blanket swaddlings, and the large
basin in which his feet were still immersed.
</p>
<p>He lifted his hand above his head in a melodramatic
way of denunciation, but the tragic effect
was completely ruined when the porcelain
basin began slipping across the hard-wood floor.
He wildly threw out both hands to clutch at something
for support, but the low chair he had occupied
was not near the dressing table nor any
other article of furniture in the room.
</p>
<p>Polly tried to save him from a fall, but he
threw off her rescuing hands; and thus he was falling
to his ungraceful finish, when he managed to
free one foot and planted it on the rug as a balance.
But the basin with its wet porcelain bottom
kept sliding ever farther away, and Tom
still rolled in the swaddling robes suddenly sat
down unceremoniously upon the floor.
</p>
<p>Polly faintly screamed when the basin overturned
and the mustard water ran in numerous
streamlets across the waxed wood and center rug.
Just at this critical moment, Mrs. Latimer came
back to give her son the dose of quinine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Tom! Why are you sitting on the
floor?&#8221; asked she, in amazement.
</p>
<p>That was the last straw. Polly had to smother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
a laugh but Tom flared out and the thick denunciations
of all the female sex, particularly western
girls, would have driven such a girl mad with
anger. But Polly understood her friend too well
to believe a word he said.
</p>
<p>Even while he still hurled every expletive he
could remember and try to enunciate, Polly sprang
over to help Mrs. Latimer raise the beswaddled
young man back into the chair. He fought off
her assistance, but she stubbornly held on to his
arms until he was seated in a proper position once
more.
</p>
<p>Then she said: &#8220;Tom dear, I&#8217;m so sorry you
have had such a wretched Christmas Day. Had
we but known you had such a cold we would have
called and taken you home with us. But now that
Christmas is over, and I haven&#8217;t had time to say
a word to you, I&#8217;ll just whisper that, as a sort of
late greeting: &#8216;If I don&#8217;t find anyone I like better
than you, during the next two years, I&#8217;ll make
a partnership proposition to you.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bolly! Whad do you mean?&#8221; gasped
Tom, expectation high once more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like you better than any other friend I ever
had, Tom, but I am determined to try business
first. Then, in two years&#8217; time if you are still of
the same mind as now, I will consider what you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
have so often planned. But not before then.
Until that time we will be the best of good pals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bolly! Whad a Gridsmad&#8217;s gifd you
habe giben me!&#8221; exclaimed Tom, his face shining
radiantly with love and vaseline.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>BEAUX OR BUSINESS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was very late when the Fabian party reached
home that Christmas night; thus there were no
confidences given or taken between the girls until
the following morning. To Eleanor&#8217;s keen sight
Polly appeared ill at ease; and in the morning,
after breakfast, the cloud seemed heavier than
before. Then Eleanor decided to find out what
unpleasant experience had occurred while at Latimers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a glorious time, last night&mdash;didn&#8217;t you,
Poll?&#8221; began Eleanor, guilelessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Until poor Tom came in with that
nasty cold in his head. His condition was enough
to ruin any one&#8217;s enjoyment, once you saw or
heard him,&#8221; replied Polly, absentmindedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A mere cold in the head is nothing to worry
about. He will probably be here, today, as fresh
as ever. That is, if the quinine he took last night
permits him to see straight.&#8221; Eleanor laughed in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
order to show her friend how unconcerned she was
about anything which might have happened at the
Latimers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you seen him, with his feet in boiling
water and mustard, his face coated with vaseline,
his eyes like Bear Forks, and his temper like a
sore hyena&#8217;s, you wouldn&#8217;t sit there and say he&#8217;d
be fresh as ever today,&#8221; Polly retorted with a
reminiscent smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder to me that he permitted you to
visit him after he had been doctored by his mother
as you say he was,&#8221; returned Eleanor, musingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He never would have, Nolla, had I not
marched right into the room without his being
aware of my presence. I never even knocked,
because his mother told me he was in her dressing-room,
off the large room. I waited in the large
room until I heard him speak, then I pretended to
be surprised and pleased to find him there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor laughed. &#8220;Yes, I can see you pretend
anything, Poll. I just know your face was as
serious as crêpe, and your pretence a thing any
child could see through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Nolla, you are all wrong! I can prove
it. But the great trouble is, how shall I get out of
what Tom believes to be true? I pretended so
well that I almost fooled myself into believing that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
I was doing right. This morning I know it is not
true,&#8221; said Polly, impatiently.
</p>
<p>Eleanor now felt her curiosity rising for she
realized she was on the verge of hearing what had
caused Polly&#8217;s concern. But she knew she must
be circumspect in her replies, or her friend would
take alarm and not say a word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, there speaks the born actress. When on
the stage, acting in a play, the artiste is carried
away by her own depth of feeling and faith in the
truth of what she is saying or doing. Now, you
see, you did the same and that proves you should
study stage-craft instead of interior decorating.&#8221;
Eleanor spoke in a jocular tone.
</p>
<p>Polly smiled at her friend, but she was too
preoccupied with her problem to pay attention to
Eleanor&mdash;whether she was in earnest or whether
she was speaking in fun.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Polly asked: &#8220;Nolla, are you engaged
to Paul?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor was taken off her feet. She never
dreamed of having Polly ask her bluntly about
her private interests in any one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-h-y, n-o-o&mdash;not ex-actly!&#8221; stammered she
in reply.
</p>
<p>Polly sat and stared at her companion as if to
search out the truth. Then she said: &#8220;Have you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
any idea of being engaged within the next year or
two?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, Poll,&#8221; returned Eleanor, finding
her depth once more, and treading water to get
her breath, &#8220;you know how I admire Paul, and
you also know that Paul says he loves me. That
was most obvious at Dalky&#8217;s party, the night Paul
arrived so unexpectedly. But when you speak of
engagements, I must remind you of the law you
laid down for me&mdash;not to tie myself to any such
entanglement until after we had had our fill of
business. Am I right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; sighed Polly. &#8220;But that does not
go to say that you obeyed my law. There may be
a secret understanding between you and Paul, and
that is what I want to hear about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be the same sort of a secret understanding
as now exists between you and Tom Latimer,&#8221;
retorted Eleanor, taking a wild chance that such
was the fact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I pity poor Paul from the bottom of my
heart,&#8221; was Polly&#8217;s unexpected reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul doesn&#8217;t seem to think he is in need of
any pity,&#8221; smiled Eleanor, as she thought of his
joy the preceding evening as he escorted her from
the Latimer&#8217;s apartment to the automobile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then it is not the same sort of secret
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
understanding. Now come out with it, Nolla, and
tell me just how far you have complicated yourself
with Paul in love, and with me in our business
venture?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Poll. That is what I wish to impress
upon you&mdash;that I am no deeper in the love
tangle than you are with Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, Nolla. Now I&#8217;ll confess, if
you promise me to do likewise. Is it a bargain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish. But let me say beforehand, I
have no more to confess than you know of already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pact! Shake, Nolla,&#8221; exclaimed Polly,
holding out her hand.
</p>
<p>Of course Eleanor was more than amazed at
such a to-do over what she considered a natural
outcome of human attraction for Polly, and she
shook the hand extended to seal the compact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There now! I&#8217;ll confess first. Last night,
when I found poor Tom in such dire condition and
wanting to die at once, I told his mother I would
comfort him, somewhat, by wishing him a merry
Christmas and showing him my business card.
You know, the ones we just got back from the
engravers late Christmas Eve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I found him in such a pitiable way that
I was sorry the moment I handed him my card.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
He took it so differently from what I had expected.
When he raved about dying and nothing
to live for, I was at my wit&#8217;s end. Finally, just
after the basin in which he was boiling his feet
slipped from under him, and sat him down unkindly
upon the floor, I was moved to encourage
him if he would but cheer up and think of living
a little longer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla, he took advantage of my weakness and
wormed a promise from me to consider myself
engaged to him, unless I found some one I liked
much better within the next two years. Now tell
me, Nolla, because you are educated in affairs like
this&mdash;where do I stand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s anxiety was so amusing to Eleanor and
the whole situation so like a farce to her maturer
love-affair, that she laughed merrily. But Polly
was too concerned to take offence at the merriment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Polly! What a little lamb you are, to be
sure! How lucky for you that I am always at
hand to keep you from being led to the slaughter&mdash;not
altar!&#8221; Eleanor laughed again at her
clever play on the hackneyed phrase.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t answer my question, Nolla. I
am most serious in this matter and I do not wish
to hear more ridicule from you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not ridiculing you or the awful mess you
have made of your life,&#8221; retorted Eleanor with
a sly grin, &#8220;but I cannot help giving vent to my
risibles when you take it all so seriously. I wonder
how you would take the measles, Poll.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh pshaw, Nolla! What has measles to do
with me, right now!&#8221; was Polly&#8217;s impatient rejoinder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. I was only wondering
why you take everything so dreadfully in earnest.
Now as far as your love tangle appears to be,
I should prognosticate&mdash;hear that word, Polly?
I am trying to act the wise magistrate for you&mdash;that
there will be no suit for breach of promise,
although there may be a case made out against
you for alienating Tom&#8217;s affections from Choko&#8217;s
Find Mine. On the other hand, you can serve
a counter suit on Tom for alienating your affections
from your first love&mdash;your business venture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While Eleanor had been explaining the law to
her friend, the latter grew more and more impatient,
and when the self-appointed magistrate
concluded her version of law, Polly sprang up
angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare, Nolla, you will never be serious even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
at death! I&#8217;m disgusted with you, so there!&#8221; and
Polly made for the door.
</p>
<p>Eleanor made after her, saying as she ran: &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure I&#8217;ll never want to take death seriously, Polly,
for that is the time of all times when we need to be
cheerful and prove to our dear ones that they have
nothing to weep over&mdash;because I am of the firm
belief that no one goes into oblivion. It is simply
progression, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sudden change from laughter to seriousness
halted Polly&#8217;s exit at the door, and she turned
to look at her friend with a strange expression in
her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla, you should have been born in April&mdash;with
the most changeable weather of the year.
One moment you are too silly for words and the
next you discourse on the most serious of all subjects.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Eleanor laughed, teasingly: &#8220;Perhaps I
should not have been born at all. Then, my
family and friends would have been saved many
trials. But I am here, you see, and they have to
make the best of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is exactly what we want to accomplish,
don&#8217;t you see? We want to make the best of you,
but you just won&#8217;t let us do it. You prefer to act
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
like a big ninny instead of the cleverest girl in the
world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always excepting you, dear!&#8221; and Eleanor
bowed low.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go again! Now I <i>am</i> mad!&#8221; and
Polly tried to get through the open doorway, but
her friend clung to her arm and refused to let her
go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment! I&#8217;ll let you go as soon as I
have a word with you. This is going to be a real
serious word, too,&#8221; promised Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Polly turned back. Eleanor stood pondering
for a moment, then said, &#8220;About Tom&#8217;s affair, I
would advise this: treat him brotherly&mdash;that is be
sisterly to him; if you are not madly in love with
him, so madly that you will jump into the Hudson
or throw yourself upon the subway track unless
you know he loves you the same way, then let
Cupid manage the whole affair. Believe me,
child, Cupid can do it far better than you or I!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Concerning Paul and myself: I told the darling
that I had a contract with you which had to be
fulfilled before I could sign up with another one&mdash;even
though that other one <i>seemed</i> to be offering
me easier work and better wages. So I&#8217;m in for
the business venture for all it is worth for the next
two, perhaps more, years. I refused to place any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
time limit on a promise to sign up with Paul.
Satisfied?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most assuredly! That is the first practical
speech I&#8217;ve ever heard you make, Nolla!&#8221; was
Polly&#8217;s emphatic reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you have sense enough to make the
same speech to Tom Latimer. Then he will follow
Paul&#8217;s example: be filled with ambition to go
back to Pebbly Pit and straighten out that caved-in
mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But both the girls were to learn that it is much
easier to talk how events should follow in sequence,
than it is to compel fate to do as she is expected
to with such events.
</p>
<p>That evening, despite his parents&#8217; advice to remain
in bed, Tom drove up in a taxi and stopped
before the Fabians&#8217; house. He paid the driver,
rushed up the steps and pulled at the doorbell.
</p>
<p>Polly had just finished dinner and was slowly
walking out of the dining-room when the maid
opened the door. Tom fairly leaped in when he
saw Polly stopping suddenly under the hall-light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my little&mdash;&#8221; he began, but Polly held up a
warning hand and frowned him to silence; then she
hurried him to the library across the hall from the
dining-room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Didn&#8217;t you tell them we
were engaged?&#8221; asked Tom, impetuously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we were what one calls engaged,
Tom. You are misunderstanding me. Of course,
I did not tell them about what never happened.&#8221;
Polly was annoyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; began Tom, arguing for himself, &#8220;I felt
sure you meant it the way I said: that you would
wear my ring and consider I had a prior right to
your love or affections.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all wrong! Because that is exactly
what I wish to retain for myself&mdash;prior right to
follow my own life-line. I did say that I liked
you more than any other friend I know, and that
I might consider you as my future fiancé if, in two
years&#8217; time, I came to the conclusion that I would
give up a business career. That&#8217;s all; and that
holds no ground for your giving me an engagement
ring, nor for me to take one and wear it. I
simply refuse to be bound in any way. Better
understand this, once for all, Tom!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The other members of the family now came in
and welcomed Tom and also insisted upon having
him tell them how much better he felt. The ring-box
which Tom had so eagerly pulled from his vest
pocket as he sat upon the divan with Polly, he now
managed to slip back again without having been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
discovered in the act. Even Eleanor failed to
see the action.
</p>
<p>Before Tom had had time to conclude his polite
answers as to the state of his health, the bell rang
a second time and the maid admitted Paul Stewart.
Nor did the evening advance far before Jim and
Ken dropped in, then came Dodo and Mr. Dalken,
and last but not least the Ashbys stopped in to inquire
how everyone was. Such &#8220;stoppings&#8221;
usually ended, as on this evening, by their remaining
until midnight.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ashby had news for his two new assistants
in business. &#8220;Late in the afternoon before
Christmas, I had a &#8217;phone call from Mrs. Courtney,
girls. She asked me to make an appointment
with you to meet her at my shop, tomorrow morning
at eleven. I promised to let you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the lady we met at the Parsippany
sale,&#8221; exclaimed Eleanor. &#8220;I wondered what had
become of her since then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she wants us to find her a few antiques,&#8221;
suggested Polly, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she plans to redecorate her boudoir,
and wants you two beginners to take the commission.
She seems to place a great deal of confidence
in your ability to please her,&#8221; said Mr.
Ashby.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>Eleanor smiled at her superior in business.
&#8220;Feeling any jealousy at our popularity?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a whit!&#8221; laughed Mr. Ashby. &#8220;It only
adds more glory to my brilliant fame, because I
was astute enough to secure such talent!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s appointment to meet the two
young decorators in a business conference came
at just the time when both Eleanor and Polly were
half-persuaded to give up their art and turn aside
to marriage, although neither girl really wanted
to take the husband instead of the career, at that
time. When Paul and Tom would be out of sight
once more, and their magnetic presences removed
so that calm business atmosphere might control
again, both girls would see they had been wise in
deferring their engagements for the present.
Hence the visit of Mrs. Courtney came at just the
critical time.
</p>
<p>Polly and Eleanor were at the Ashby Shops a
full hour before the lady could be expected. But
they put in the hour in going over the latest
samples of boudoir textiles, new ideas in furniture,
and fascinating designs of cushions, draperies and
other accessories for a boudoir.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney was very frank and pleasant
in her cordial greeting. For all her fame as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
social leader in New York and the fabulous wealth
accredited to her, she seemed very plain and
friendly. Eleanor could not help contrasting her
with her mother and Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, girls, how many millions of dollars
have you made in your profession since I saw you
at that farce of a sale in New Jersey,&#8221; said she
smilingly after they had seated themselves in the
small reception room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That <i>was</i> too bad, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We mean, it was too bad for that nice old
auctioneer to be used by the city man as he certainly
was. We met old Mr. Van Styne before
that sale, you know, and he was so honest!&#8221; said
Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I learned. But I was annoyed at the city
man&#8217;s methods of getting his regular customers so
far from the city in order to make money out of
them; I went down to his office and told him very
plainly what I thought of such trickery as he had
played on me. He apologised in every way when
he learned that I would never buy another thing of
him; but I knew his apologies were the result of
his fear of losing a good customer. I told him
frankly that I would not accept his regrets. I have
heard from him several times since then, but I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
have paid no attention to his requests to allow him
to explain the circumstance which ended in that
sale in the country.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did take time to write to this Mr. Van Styne,
however, and ask for the truth, as I did not want
to condemn the city man if there might be extenuating
reasons for the sale. The old man in Morristown
answered that he had been used as an instrument
in the padded sale. He had known nothing
of the manner in which the antiques had been
brought from the City and placed in the house,
until afterward. He had sent letters to his
clientele who favored him with confidence, and
many were at that sale, much to his discomfiture
when he learned the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Van Styne added that he had taken the
trouble to find out from a few of his trusting
customers that the articles they had purchased at
that sale, and which were claimed in the catalogues
to be genuine antiques, were clever imitations.
In fact, a refectory table said to be of
genuine Jacobean period, was manufactured in the
man&#8217;s factory on the East Side. Even the worm-holes
had been drilled in the wood and the worn
slab of wood of the top was done by the plane.
To keep himself out of Court, the clever fellow
had to give back the buyer&#8217;s money and send up to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
Morristown and get the articles of &#8216;newly-made
antique&#8217; furniture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that!&#8221; exclaimed Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But those buyers should have prosecuted the
cheat!&#8221; declared Eleanor, impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I said, but one of them
wrote me she was going away for the winter; she
could not postpone her trip to try the case at
Court. Thus she took the easiest way out.&#8221;
Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s determined expression showed
what she would have done had she been the dupe
of such a clever dealer.
</p>
<p>The subject was abruptly changed when Mrs.
Courtney added: &#8220;Now we must talk business,
young ladies. I am sure you cannot spare your
valuable time in gossip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly and Eleanor glanced at each other and
smiled at the idea of their &#8220;valuable time,&#8221; but
Mrs. Courtney launched at once into the cause of
her call that morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never felt at peace with the atrocious decorations
in my boudoir, although one of the highest-priced
firms in New York did the room for me.
I know it was a case of making me take the costliest
materials without regard to harmony or temperament.
Now I wish to have you girls see what
<i>you</i> would do with the suite. While I am here,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
I thought you might show me several suites exhibited
on the floor and tell me which you would
prefer for a woman of my age.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly immediately signified that she was ready
to escort Mrs. Courtney to the elevator, thence to
the exhibition rooms where every conceivable
period and price of boudoir furnishings were to be
seen and examined.
</p>
<p>The three stepped from the elevator, and Polly
was leading the way to the boudoir suites; Mrs.
Courtney watched with deep interest as she spoke
in a low voice, to Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack Baxter called on me, one evening before
he went West; he told me that your remarkable
young friend had everything in life to make a
young girl want to have a good time, yet she
chose a profession for herself in place of gayety
and beaux.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor smiled and nodded affirmatively but
said nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is one of the reasons I wanted to meet
you young ladies again. It is so gratifying to
find any young girl, these days, who takes life in
earnest. Of all the flippant, mothlike creatures I
find flapping about at receptions or teas, I have
yet to find one in every thousand who really thinks
of anything other than cigarettes, matinees, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
dress. It is positively revolting to me to have my
rooms clouded with cigarette smoke, yet what can
a hostess do? The women have gone mad over
the habit. The danger lies in their not being able
to break the influence as readily as they form
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly overheard the latter part of this speech
and smiled admiringly at her client. Then they
came to the boudoir exhibit.
</p>
<p>A very pleasant hour passed while Polly and
Eleanor told Mrs. Courtney of their visits to
galleries in Europe, and in hearing Mrs. Courtney
speak of her amusing excursions in quest of the antique.
Finally the lady remembered an appointment,
and in amazement found her wrist-watch
told her it was twelve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! I had an imperative engagement at
the dentist&#8217;s at twelve-fifteen. How could this
hour have passed so rapidly?&#8221; said she, hurrying
to the elevator in advance of the girls.
</p>
<p>While waiting for the man to come for them,
the two young salesladies wondered if their customer
would leave without an order, or word of
encouragement regarding the future of her boudoir.
</p>
<p>On the elevator going down, Mrs. Courtney
said: &#8220;When you have time to come to my address
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
and look at the suite, just let me know by telephone
and I will make it a point to be at home to meet
you, to go into the work in earnest. I am confident
you can give the right atmosphere to my
boudoir.&#8221; Just as the elevator reached the
ground floor, Mrs. Courtney handed Polly and
Eleanor each a card upon which she wrote her
private telephone number.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, good-morning, my friends. Remember
what I said to you about having chosen the right
pathway, for the present. You will make all the
better wives and mothers for having had a genuine
business experience. How superior is your ideal
to those of empty-headed society misses who live
but to dance or drink or waste their true substance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With such praise of their endeavors, the lady
left Polly and Eleanor; and they stood where she
left them, holding her cards in their hands, but still
gazing at the revolving doors through which she
had passed and then disappeared.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>BUSINESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Ruth and Dodo had been sadly neglected during
the Christmas Season, but after Paul returned
to Denver and Tom accepted his verdict that Polly
would give no valuable thought to lovers for the
next two years, the two young decorators took
time to encourage their younger partners in the
work they had chosen.
</p>
<p>Ruth and Dodo were not as deeply in earnest
as Polly and Eleanor had been in applying themselves
to the studies given at Cooper Union; they
considered themselves martyrs to the cause of
womanly work. Mr. Fabian often sighed in despair
over Dodo&#8217;s ideals in ancient architecture, or
Ruth&#8217;s recitations of applied designs. Polly and
Eleanor laughed at these trials of teacher and
student and kept urging both sides not to lose faith
but to keep on until they won the prize.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the two advanced students visited
every exhibit or lecture given on their beloved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
work, and thus acquired more of the idealistic experiences
in art. For business application of their
understanding of decorating, Mrs. Courtney supplied
one channel of such testing; and Mr. Dalken
offered another outlet for their wisdom, for he
had decided to erect a magnificent office building
on upper Fifth Avenue, and keep the entire top
floor as a private apartment for himself.
</p>
<p>The girls had many interesting mornings in
Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s home, listening to her accounts
of trips to every country in quest of curios and
antiques. Her residence was filled with the results
of her travels, and her memory teemed with
thrilling stories of adventure for the rare and
beautiful trophies she secured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still one interesting spot on this globe
which I am keen to visit, but I have never had the
opportunity to go as I wish to go,&#8221; said Mrs.
Courtney, one day, after she had been showing
the two girls the collection of Filipino curios she
got during a six months&#8217; stay at the Philippines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have said there was no spot where
you have not been,&#8221; laughed Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is, and that is the South Sea Isles.
I have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; gasped both the girls, unconsciously
interrupting the speaker.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney laughed. &#8220;Yes, the South Sea
Isles. Do not think them so cannibalistic as report
has it, my dears. I know an American who
has lived there more than twenty years and he
says that for climate and interesting life, give him
the South Sea Islands. He almost persuaded me
to take the trip when he was here last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he an old friend?&#8221; asked Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he is a man I used to commission to find
certain curios for me. He tells me that textiles
woven and colored by the natives of those islands
are the most beautiful things ever seen. The
carvings and hammered brasses are more gorgeous
than those of Benares or of the East. He
has made quite a fortune out of exporting selected
articles from the Isles to the United States, but the
great difficulty in such trade is the uncertain transportation
methods. His goods may reach their
destination and again they may not. It depends
on the character of the owner or captain of the
vessel. He all but persuaded me to buy or lease a
sea-going yacht and make the trip for a year&#8217;s outing.
He promised me that all costs would quickly
be defrayed by the valuable cargo which could be
stored away in very small space on board the
yacht.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were so keen about visiting that place
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
why did you renounce it?&#8221; queried Eleanor, wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I could not induce any of my friends
to accept my invitation to join my party for such
an outing.&#8221; Mrs Courtney laughed as she remembered
the expressions on the faces of her friends
when they heard of the proposed voyage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, girls, some of my invited guests
asked me to go to Monte Carlo, or to the Orient,
instead. So that broke up the plan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; sighed Polly, &#8220;I only wish I had
been invited!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you have gone willingly?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Courtney, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I? Say, Nolla, would you have gone
with me?&#8221; was Polly&#8217;s instant retort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me now and see?&#8221; laughed Eleanor to
Mrs. Courtney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, girls, do not joke! I am seriously inclined
to take that trip, providing I can induce the
right group of friends to accompany me. The
cost of a yacht would be no small matter in these
days of high costs, but I would have a year&#8217;s intense
satisfaction out of such a trip, and Mr.
Needham said he felt sure the costs would be met
by the cargo I could carry out and another I could
bring back on the round trip.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If our gold mine gets to working again, or
should the lava cliffs open soon, both Polly and I
would love to enlist for just such an adventure.
But there would be no opportunity to add to our
knowledge of decorating, would there?&#8221; suggested
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you took your lessons with you,
and found clients out there who wanted you to
decorate their grass huts in the good approved
American way,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Courtney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla, we ought not to dream of such a trip,
because we are tied to a two-year agreement with
each other, you know. Then we&#8217;ve got to give
a definite answer to those life-partners, you
know,&#8221; was Polly&#8217;s lugubrious reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Polly! In such an unexpected
matter as our going to the South Seas, a mere beau
will have to bide his time. We may find a Fiji
Islander more interesting to us than one of our
Yankee beaus,&#8221; laughed Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney heard and pondered what had
just been said; her next words did not hint of her
having heard the discussion, however.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I do take such a trip, it shall not be in the
approved line of Cook&#8217;s Tours. I want to adventure
in absolute freedom, with no tagging tourists
or other obstacles to a perfect adventure. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
would carefully select a party of fifteen or twenty
harmonious souls and charter or buy a private
yacht. Then start and stop as we pleased. No
hurry, no lagging, unless we chose. It seems to
me that such a wonderful outing would bring
peace, at last, to my restless spirit.&#8221; Mrs. Courtney
sighed.
</p>
<p>The girls laughed because they thought she
was joking. But Mrs. Courtney was in earnest,
as they were to find out. However, the topic now
being discussed was the South Sea Isle trip so she
was determined to conclude that before she
launched another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I invited you two girls to accompany me as
private assistants during the trip, and should we
find a score of kindred spirits willing to take a trip
such as I plan, why could you not steal six months
or a year from your profession, in order to see
the world? Surely it would do you no harm, and
you are still young enough to go on with your
work when you return to New York?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Polly and Eleanor seemed to have exactly the
same idea. But Eleanor spoke impetuously of it,
while Polly pondered seriously. &#8220;Dear me! If
only Mr. Dalken could spare the time to take <i>his</i>
yacht and invite us to accompany him on just such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
a voyage&mdash;what a wonderful trip it would be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney glanced at the girls, then said:
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard so much of your great Mr. Dalken
but I&#8217;ve never seen him. How old a man is he,
and what does he look like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dalky is not as old as he looks, because
he has had such an unhappy life, you know; that is
how we came to love him so! We felt keenly for
him,&#8221; exclaimed Eleanor, regardless of the sharp
nudge Polly gave her as a warning to hold her
tongue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know his silly wife, poor man!&#8221; murmured
Mrs. Courtney. She seemed to be lost in
a sad strain of thought for a short time, and the
girls hesitated to speak, just then.
</p>
<p>Soon, however, she heaved a deep sigh and
looked up to smile at the serious faces opposite
her. &#8220;Well, perhaps there is a great happiness in
store for your good friend, to repay him for all
he has silently endured these past years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We sincerely hope so!&#8221; affirmed Polly,
earnestly. &#8220;If anyone deserves peace and joy,
dear Dalky does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How little the world really knows of the
sorrows of those who bear their cross in silence!&#8221;
sighed Mrs. Courtney. &#8220;Now, I have heard said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
that Mr. Dalken is a very gay personage who
knows how to make the most of his money and
time. But that report came from his wife, so I
took it with a grain of salt. I know from my own
experience just how the sinner tries to smear the
saint with his own crimes although I do not mean
by that that I am a saint.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you had no unhappy experience in your
life, Mrs. Courtney!&#8221; exclaimed Eleanor, not from
curiosity but from the desire to hear her esteemed
friend declare that she had had only joy in her
days. Mrs. Courtney understood the motive that
urged the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear children, my married experience was
much like that of your beloved friend. The difference
being that my gay husband used my position
and wealth to boost himself to the place where
he found more agreeable companions than I
proved to be. Out of sheer self-respect I was
forced to divorce him. Then I began my wanderings
over the globe, and finally settled in this city
where I was practically unknown. You see, my
pride could not brook the pity of my friends although
they approved the only course open for me
when my husband eloped with another man&#8217;s
wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear Mrs. Courtney!&#8221; sighed Eleanor,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
ready tears springing to her eyes. But Polly
crept over and placed a sympathetic hand upon
that of her hostess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems ages ago, my children,&#8221; added Mrs.
Courtney. &#8220;I was only eighteen when I married
and I was twenty-one when I divorced my husband.
I never had a child, and I have always felt as
though I had been given a very wretched deal in
life, for I love children. Because of my experience,
I can advise other young girls&mdash;not to marry
too young, nor to accept a man for his looks or
manners. A girl needs to be experienced from
business, or travel and association with men, before
she is capable of judging wisely and selecting the
proper mate for life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The bond created that morning between the
mature woman and the two young girls, proved
to be of such quality as would last. And such a
friend as Mrs. Courtney would be for two young
girls, was one of the benefits both Polly and Eleanor
received by visiting country auctions of a
higher class. Not that the particular sale at
Parsippany was &#8220;higher class,&#8221; because it was
proved to have been a fake sale, but the type of
buyers it attracted were of an advanced type of
mentality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, children, you have told me nothing more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
about your good friend Dalken! Tell me more
of him. I just heard of his wife&#8217;s latest project,
and I wish to be informed first hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Mrs. Courtney? His
wife&#8217;s latest project?&#8221; asked Polly, fearfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, perhaps you were not aware that she is in
Reno? She found an affinity, it seems, during her
visit abroad, last summer, and it became necessary
for her to sever her legal ties if she wished to
marry this other man. I heard of the scandal
but not being interested in the woman, and not
knowing the man, I paid no attention to the suit.
Divorce cases are so common in these degenerate
days.&#8221; Mrs. Courtney sighed again, and showed
her disapproval of the modern style of marriages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Dalky! I wonder if he knows of this?&#8221;
cried Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He would have to, dear, because she would
have to serve him with papers, you see,&#8221; explained
Mrs. Courtney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he never said a word to any one nor did
he let us see he was disturbed in any way,&#8221; added
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the poor man is relieved to have it so.
At least, he will be exempt from paying her such
an outrageous income, you know. I take for
granted that he will put in his defence, thus absolving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
himself from alimony,&#8221; explained Mrs. Courtney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be exactly like him to keep quiet and
let that horrid woman get all she can. He is so
magnanimous, you know, that he would think to
himself &#8216;She was the mother of my children, and
as such I must not deprive her of what she may
need&#8217;.&#8221; Polly&#8217;s voice had a dual tone as she spoke:
one of sympathy for Mr. Dalken, one of scorn for
Mrs. Dalken.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney laughed softly. &#8220;I am getting
my impressions of your friend in piece-meal. You
have not yet told me about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is because you&#8217;ve told us such astonishing
news. But now I&#8217;ll tell you all about good old
Dalky,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;He is a handsome man
of about forty-two or four, I think. Isn&#8217;t he,
Polly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, about that age,&#8221; agreed Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, besides his being handsome and middle-aged,
he is loving, awfully rich, both in money and
good friends, and one of the most intelligent mortals
I ever met!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor&#8217;s description made Mrs. Courtney
smile. &#8220;One would be led to think you had met
all kinds and conditions of mortals in your long,
long life, child,&#8221; remarked she.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think I am very much older in life
than <i>seems</i> to be,&#8221; mused Eleanor. &#8220;I feel somehow,
that I have lived many centuries before this
queer modern experience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have been reading theosophical
books, my dear,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Courtney, eyeing
Eleanor closely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never have. I&#8217;m not interested in any
such form of research&mdash;not yet,&#8221; she laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolla, we ought to be going&mdash;really! Every
time we come here to talk boudoir decorating we
switch off into some byway of personal interest,
and that makes us come again to get down to
work,&#8221; said Polly, rising and adjusting her hat,
preparatory to saying good-by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about our round-trip to the South
Sea Isles?&#8221; was Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s query.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t coming off, at once, is it? You&#8217;ve
got to find a group who are companionable, and
you&#8217;ve got to get the yacht,&#8221; said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not take me more than a week to do
both. When I make up my mind to a thing, I
generally do it,&#8221; returned Mrs. Courtney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d have to gain the consent of our parents
before we could even <i>think</i> of taking such a marvellous
voyage,&#8221; declared Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the main point is this: would you really
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
care to go, or would you prefer staying in New
York to continue your profession?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Courtney.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d love to go with you, but I&#8217;m not sure
I&#8217;d want to remain away from my work for a
whole year,&#8221; was Polly&#8217;s thoughtful answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we entertained any ideas of taking the voyage,
the best time for us to start would be next
Fall. Then we could spend our entire winter in
the tropics and escape the heat in the equator in
the summer, or rainy season, by sailing home
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it sounds great! It remains to see who
would go,&#8221; said Eleanor. Then the girls said
good-by, and started away, full of the unusual invitation
they had heard that afternoon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure mother and father would not wish me
to go,&#8221; said Polly, after the subject had been exhausted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, you couldn&#8217;t offer the excuse that
you were going for advancement in your profession&mdash;as
we did when we wanted to tour Europe,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaving the thrilling trip out of our minds
for a time, I want to ask you if you suspected anything
troubling Dalky, lately?&#8221; said Polly, seriously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing. He has seemed just the same as
ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I should have said. Then he
may not know about his wife&#8217;s perfidy, and I think
we ought to prepare him for such news, Nolla.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, we tried to force an adopted son on him,
once, and since that time I have been wary of trying
to interfere in any other of his personal affairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us talk it over with Prof. and ask
what he thinks about telling Mr. Ashby,&#8221; suggested
Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more like sense. We&#8217;ll tell Mr. Ashby
ourselves, when we get back to the Shops.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Ashby was told the story as told by
Mrs. Courtney but he seemed not surprised as
the girls expected him to be. He merely shook
his head sympathetically and said nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know it?&#8221; asked Polly, amazed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We all knew of it a few weeks ago. Poor
Dalky refused all our advice to fight the divorce
and exempt himself from paying alimony&mdash;as he
will have to do for not putting in a defence.
He smiled tolerantly and explained: &#8216;If she wants
any of my money she is welcome to it. I have
more than I can use, you know&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There! That is exactly what I said he would
do!&#8221; declared Polly, vehemently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why does he let her have it? There are
so many ways he could make poor people happy,
instead of throwing his wealth away on such a mercenary
creature!&#8221; wailed Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no right to question his motives,
Nolla,&#8221; said Mr. Ashby, seriously. &#8220;I do not
wish to speak of this again, unless he himself
mentions the subject to you girls. He has seemed
anxious to keep the news from you, for some
reason. But I firmly believe the poor man still
has a shred of love for his wife alive in his bosom,
and that is why he will not oppose her in any way
she wishes to secure happiness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That night when Polly and Eleanor sat together
doing some home-work on decorating, Polly suddenly
looked up and said: &#8220;Nolla, if only our dear
Dalky could meet our dear Mrs. Courtney&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
they make a fine couple?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Poll! There you go again! I have
tried to keep from thinking that very thing, ever
since I heard Mrs. Courtney tell us of that horrid
woman&#8217;s being in Reno. Our Dalky will be free,
and what so great as to have him fall in love with
a really appreciative woman.&#8221; Eleanor clasped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
her hands and expressed ecstatic joy at the very
idea of such bliss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the whole plan would be ruined if it turned
out that Dalky was still in love with his first wife,
you know,&#8221; argued Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t take long to get him out of it,&#8221; retorted
Eleanor. &#8220;With such a lovely woman as
Mrs. Courtney to be had for the loving and
asking, I&#8217;d like to wager all I have that Dalky
would walk into the snare.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What snare? Who&#8217;d set it for his faltering
steps?&#8221; laughed Polly, enjoying this romancing to
the utmost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we would, to be sure. Now look at it in
a practical way, Poll. There is Mrs. Courtney:
very good-looking, rich, refined, lonely, about
thirty-five or thirty-eight, at most. Here is our
Dalky, also handsome, rich, refined, lonely (but
for us) about forty years old, and just the man to
have a wonderful wife to make him happy. Is
that not an ideal match?&#8221; Eleanor tossed her
head wisely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what <i>we</i> think! But we are not going
to marry Dalky nor Mrs. Courtney. They may
not agree with us, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, nothing like trying out a thing to see
how it works. Now we must scheme to bring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
those two together and let them find out how
desirable each is for the other,&#8221; suggested Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is a good plan&mdash;bring them together
and see how they seem to get along,&#8221; said
Polly, musingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then. How shall we do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could we not invite Mrs. Courtney to inspect
some of the materials we are going to order for
Dalky&#8217;s apartment? We could so plan that
Dalky would be there at the same time. Then
they would meet and hear that each one is the
great and only friend the other has heard so much
about from us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a fine way to get them together,&#8221;
said Polly. &#8220;Now when shall it be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner, the better,&#8221; retorted Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to get that book of new imported
samples of damask, this week, Nolla.
Why not ask Mrs. Courtney to look at them.
As they are ordered for Dalky&#8217;s apartment, what
more natural than he should drop in to look them
over?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eleanor clapped Polly on the back with approval,
and both girls then put their heads together
and romanced about the great match they
would bring about.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>A few days after this conversation, the much-desired
package came by European post. It was
the book of imported samples which had been
ordered for Mr. Dalken&#8217;s inspection before he
would place an order for the materials. The
work at Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s residence had been delayed
because the youthful decorators said they
wished to look over the magnificent materials from
Paris. When they were sure of Mr. Dalken&#8217;s
visit to the Shops that morning, they also insisted
upon Mrs. Courtney coming in to look over the
materials.
</p>
<p>The two plotters could hardly keep from hugging
each other when they knew that both friends
were coming, and the opportunity of having them
meet and fall in love with each other was given
at last.
</p>
<p>But they did not allow for Fate.
</p>
<p>There happened to be a socialistic parade of
demonstration against work, or some such complaint,
that noon; and just as the parade reached
that section of Fifth Avenue where the Ashby
Shops were located, the police held up all vehicular
traffic. All cars were diverted from the
Avenue to side streets, but those unfortunate
cars caught just at the point of crossing the street,
had to back and wait until those behind had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
backed out of the congestion, before they could
slowly make their way out.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s chauffeur had just attempted
to cross the Avenue in order to turn in front of
the Ashby Shops, when the signal came and all
traffic, up or down or cross-town, was held up until
the parade should have passed. Mrs. Courtney
was furious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Back out and we&#8217;ll go around a side street to
get to my destination,&#8221; spoke she to the chauffeur.
</p>
<p>The man glanced in the mirror to see if the
way behind was open, and finding no car directly
in his pathway, he began to quickly back out. In
the moment he took his eye from the reflector,
another car shot up close to Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s
automobile; thus her driver backed suddenly into
the newly arrived car behind.
</p>
<p>There was a smash of lamps, a grinding of
fenders and the interlocking of back and front
bumpers. The passengers were rudely thrown
from the luxurious cushioned seats, and Mrs.
Courtney had her new imported hat crushed out
of shape.
</p>
<p>The two chauffeurs jumped down and began to
blame each other for the accident; Mr. Dalken
managed to pick himself up from the floor of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
limousine and step stiffly out to learn who was to
blame. Mrs. Courtney was sure she was in the
right; and when the handsome gentleman came
up to her car to tell her she had a stupid chauffeur,
for he should have looked well before backing
so recklessly into the congested tangle of cars
behind him, she resented his charge.
</p>
<p>While Mr. Dalken stood beside Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s
car trying to convince her she was in the
wrong, the two chauffeurs began to use their fists
upon each other. Then, in a few minutes&#8217; time,
the officer stationed at the corner to maintain order
for the paraders, rushed up and arrested both
combatants. Naturally, this caused their employers
to see that justice was done, and thus it
happened that all contestants accompanied the officer
to the police-station.
</p>
<p>Meantime Polly and Eleanor waited and
waited, but no one came to inspect their sample
book. They telephoned Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s house
and were told she had left, in her car, fully an
hour before. Then they telephoned Mr. Dalken&#8217;s
office and heard that he had driven away in
his car fully an hour before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old parade must have held them up,&#8221;
suggested Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s over, now, and they surely could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
have been here if they were detained at one of the
nearby cross-streets,&#8221; said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>Another half hour passed and then two cars
drove up and stopped before the Ashby Shops.
Two people stepped from their individual cars
and two angry people stood and stared at each
other. Then Mr. Dalken, recovering first, bowed
stiffly and walked across the pavement to enter
the Shop door. Mrs. Courtney had started to
cross the sidewalk before she realized that her unknown
opponent was entering the same Shop she
was bound for. She passed through the door he
held open, and sent him a careless glance of
thanks, then looked around for the girls whom she
had expected to meet there.
</p>
<p>Neither girl was in sight, and the lady now
asked one of the salesmen, &#8220;Where shall I find
Miss Brewster or Miss Maynard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just step this way, Madam. I&#8217;ll take you to
their private office,&#8221; was the polite reply.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Courtney glanced in a large mirror to
assure herself that her hat was presentable, then
followed her escort. As she reached the partly
closed door of the office used by the young decorators,
she heard a man&#8217;s voice. The same voice
which had been accusing her chauffeur of bad judgment
and ignorance of city laws. Before she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
could change her mind about entering the room,
however, the escort had knocked and Polly flung
the door open. She welcomed the new visitor.
</p>
<p>Both girls were tickled to pieces to find how
their plot was coming on apace: both dear friends
were now together at the same time, and all that
was needed was for them to be introduced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t this just lovely!&#8221; cried Eleanor, acting
her part very well. &#8220;To find both our friends
here at the same time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mrs. Courtney, this is our dear Mr.
Dalken,&#8221; said Polly, politely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>this</i> is the dear friend we have told you of
so often, Dalky!&#8221; added Eleanor, effusively.
</p>
<p>The lady and gentleman bowed distantly but
never smiled; the girls wondered at their strange
behavior. Then Mr. Dalken said sarcastically:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have met before. In fact, the lady is
obliged to me for having spared her chauffeur a
fine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; gasped Polly, all at sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He means, my dears, that he took us to the
police station a short time ago, just because his
stupid chauffeur wouldn&#8217;t back out of the congestion.
Naturally, when my man tried to back out
the car grazed the one behind, and that started
the fight,&#8221; explained Mrs. Courtney.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, Madam. <i>I</i> did not take you to
the station house. You took yourself in order to
save your chauffeur. And I went to see that my
poor man had simple justice in the case,&#8221; said Mr.
Dalken, bowing low in mock humility.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! Isn&#8217;t this dreadful after all we
hoped for!&#8221; cried Polly, throwing herself in a
chair and burying her face in her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is so awful, Polly dear?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Courtney, springing over to the troubled girl and
placing an arm about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! I am so heart-broken over this misfortune!&#8221;
cried Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What misfortune, Polly dear?&#8221; now asked
Mr. Dalken, coming close to the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh! I can&#8217;t speak of it!&#8221; sobbed
Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I can comfort her, Madam, if you will
allow me,&#8221; suggested Mr. Dalken, anxious to take
Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s place as comforter.
</p>
<p>She sent him a glance that said as plain as
could be: &#8220;I can comfort her myself&mdash;you need
not mind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Eleanor stood and rapidly pondered
the situation. She felt like laughing outrageously
at the prank Cupid had played on them, but she
dared not utter a sound of mirth because that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
might spoil everything. And there might be a
possible chance of saving the day, after all.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, without any previous notice, Eleanor
fell upon the other chair by the table and dropped
her head upon her folded arms. Her body shook
nervously, and Mr. Dalken believed her to be
crying, too. He hastened to assure her that there
was really nothing to cry about, but his assurance
only caused the girl to quake the more.
</p>
<p>Eleanor was not crying, but had felt that she
must laugh or leave the room. As she had no desire
to leave, she tried to hide her laughing in her
arms upon the table. But when Mr. Dalken began
to comfort her, she lost all control of herself
and had an attack of hysterical laughter.
</p>
<p>The two distraught adults were not able to cope
with the situation, and they looked at each other
in mute appeal. Mr. Dalken was the first to
speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better bury the hatchet and do something
for the children,&#8221; said he, anxiously. &#8220;Do
you know what to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had I better get a doctor, or something?&#8221;
added he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better get <i>some</i>thing,&#8221; replied Mrs. Courtney,
without thinking how silly it must sound.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>This sent Eleanor off into another wild spell of
laughter, but Polly began to quiet now that she
heard her friend making such a disturbance. The
ungoverned laughter attracted Mr. Ashby who
had just entered the Shops.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well! What has happened?&#8221; was the
natural thing for him to say, the moment he entered
the room.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dalken tried to explain that a slight shock
had occasioned the hysteria, and then Mr. Ashby
ran for the jug of icewater on the small stand
by the door. Eleanor was liberally soaked with
water before she could control her nerves, but once
she could gasp again, she cried, &#8220;Oh, Mr. Ashby!
make our two dear friends patch up their quarrel!
I shall have another fit unless they shake hands
right before my face and promise never again to
act like children!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the logic of this accusation seemed apparent
to all present, Mr. Dalken smiled graciously upon
Mrs. Courtney and she held out her hand without
further animosity. Then Mr. Ashby had to hear
the story of the accident.
</p>
<p>As it was concluded he laughed heartily and
said, &#8220;When I came in, just now, I saw two chauffeurs
sitting on the running board of Dalky&#8217;s car,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
smoking cigarettes and laughing together as if
they were twin brothers. No sign of disagreement
<i>there</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh the wretches! And in the station house
they called each other all sorts of bad names and
swore to do away with each other the moment they
found an opportunity,&#8221; complained Mrs. Courtney.
</p>
<p>The others laughed at her pathetic voice, and
Mr. Dalken said, &#8220;When they discovered they
were both Swedes they decided they had best combine
their forces against the common enemy-employer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now that reconciliation had been brought about
between these two good friends, Eleanor wondered
what next to do to further the match she had determined
to bring about. She looked at Polly for inspiration,
but Polly seemed to lack any initiative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, girls! Now that you have agreed to remain
yet a little longer on this earth with us, I
shall have to be saying good-by,&#8221; declared Mr.
Dalken, bowing before Mrs. Courtney in his
most dignified manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Dalky! Wait just a minute!&#8221; cried
Eleanor. Then turning to Polly for help, she
added, &#8220;We want Mrs. Courtney and you to come
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
and dine with us, some evening, this week. Not at
Mr. Fabian&#8217;s, you know, but at a nice quaint little
place we know of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was news to Polly, but she waited to hear
more before she spoke. Mr. Dalken laughed and
waited for Mrs. Courtney to speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this? Do you need a chaperone for
an evening?&#8221; said she, trying to fathom Eleanor&#8217;s
thoughts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! But you see, Mr. Ashby always takes
his important clients to a famous restaurant for
dinner, so we have to do the same. You two are
our first big customers, and I want to do the business
up as it should be done.&#8221; Every one laughed
at Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the circumstances, I think I should be
the host and you three ladies my guests,&#8221; suggested
Mr. Dalken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;anyway you say, Dalky, just so long as
we get together for an evening,&#8221; sighed Eleanor,
as if relieved at the change of plans. This called
forth another, heartier, laugh at her expense.
</p>
<p>One evening, therefore, the four, now good
friends, met at one of the new unique cabarets, and
having enjoyed dinner and the dancing, they spoke
of Mrs. Courtney&#8217;s idea of taking a trip to the
South Sea Isles. Mr. Dalken laughed immoderately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
at the mention of the place selected for a
pleasure trip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I am truly sorry you have set your
hearts on going to the South Seas, for I had been
secretly planning a little jaunt on my own account.
One reason I bought that sea-going yacht
was to have my best friends take short voyages
with me, whenever we could get away from business.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I find that I must try to break away from New
York in early Spring, and the doctor says a sea-voyage
is the best vacation I can possibly take.
Hence I wanted to have my two girls with me. If
you are planning to go to the South Seas I suppose
it will be out of the question for you to go to the
Orient, on <i>my</i> planned trip?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Mr. Dalken paused to watch the effect of
this speech, both the girls &#8220;Oh&#8217;ed and Ah&#8217;ed&#8221; and
glanced at Mrs. Courtney. She said nothing and
her face was a blank so no one could read her
mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had jotted down a list of names of sociable
spirits, such as the Fabians, the Ashbys, the Alexanders,
the Brewsters, the Maynards, the Latimers,
the Evans, the Stewarts, and Mrs. Courtney
with Jack Baxter to look after her in lieu of
other escort. It may be impossible for all members
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
in the families I mention to continue with us
on the voyage, but they can accompany us part
way and then come back home. I planned to go
via the Panama Canal, and thus on to Hawaii,
touching there for a short visit to the Islands, and
those of our party who must return to the States,
can get back by steamer to California and thence
to their respective homes. We will sail on to the
land of cherry blossoms and pigtails. But you
girls with one short sentence blast all these cherished
dreams.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Dalky! We wouldn&#8217;t change your
plans for the world!&#8221; exclaimed Polly, anxiously.
&#8220;You see, the South Sea Isles will wait until we
can get there, but you and your plans are apt to
change&mdash;as the railroad guides read&mdash;without
notice at any time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A laugh followed Polly&#8217;s remark, and Mr.
Dalken added, &#8220;Well just mull over this project
for a time and give me your individual opinions
about it. Of course, we would be crowded if
everyone in the families mentioned were to accept
my invitation and take the round trip; but I feel
quite safe in inviting all because I am sure I can
bank on certain ones refusing to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you could tear father or mother
away from Pebbly Pit,&#8221; remarked Polly, wistfully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I know for certain that mother and Bob
wouldn&#8217;t give up their summer season at a fashionable
resort, just to join a party of old-fashioned
sea-farers,&#8221; laughed Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you could persuade your father
to join us?&#8221; asked Mr. Dalken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet he would go as far as Honolulu, anyway!&#8221;
said Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one for certain to start with!&#8221; laughed
Mr. Dalken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is Polly and myself and Mrs.
Courtney, for certain&mdash;and that makes four; with
yourself, we are five!&#8221; exulted Eleanor, drawing
forth another laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is settled, eh? We sail for the Orient
without more ado, just as soon as your extensive
business deals are done and you will need a long
rest in order to recuperate for next year&#8217;s work,&#8221;
chuckled Mr. Dalken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If our two clients would postpone their decorating
for a year, we might be able to start tomorrow,&#8221;
remarked Polly, smilingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the clients are obdurate, especially when
the decorators need payment and prestige to succeed
in their profession. Besides, the owner of
the yacht is not keen on sailing the seas in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
middle of winter and then land in China in the wet
season.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is right,&#8221; admitted Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we should really take such a trip, Dalky,
what is the best time of the year to start?&#8221; asked
Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we could leave New York in May or
June, dawdle along the route until we reach Southern
California. Those who cannot take time to
go to Hawaii, can railroad themselves back home,
and we can sail leisurely across the Pacific to visit
the Hawaiian Islands. There again, those who
cannot go on to the Orient with the decorators who
need to study customs and periods in the Far East,
may say good-by to us and watch us go west, while
they go east back to business.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we take our time, stopping at the Philippines
on the way, we ought to do Japan and China and
even the principal parts of India, in a few months.
We can bid the East good-by about March and
escape the unpleasant season there. By taking a
direct route home we might reach New York in
June. It all depends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful! And all our
dearest friends with us!&#8221; cried Polly, clasping her
hands in ecstasy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, dear! If only Tom will let you go,
Polly!&#8221; sighed Eleanor, mischievously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom! What has Tom got to do with it?&#8221;
demanded Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, he says you ought to consider
his wishes more, since he is sure you are his soul-mate,&#8221;
teased Eleanor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner he finds out that I propose keeping
my own soul in custody the better it will be for
Tom!&#8221; declared Polly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now! That doesn&#8217;t sound much as if
our Polly was deeply in love, does it, Dalky?&#8221;
laughed Eleanor, clapping her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought she was! She was moved by
compassion for Tom, to partly agree to consider
his proposal. I knew she would not forfeit her
profession for the doubtful result of conjugal
bliss,&#8221; remarked Mr. Dalken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hem&mdash;she&#8217;s right!&#8221; asserted Mrs. Courtney.
&#8220;When two people, as you and I are, are on hand
to prevent our young friends from precipitating
themselves into double harness before they have
thoroughly studied their own minds and desires,
we ought to succeed in the work because we speak
from experience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Mr. Dalken, reminiscently; &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
would never marry the finest woman on earth,
after my first venture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor would I accept a man, even though he
presented himself to me in guise of a saint! Even
saints have their bad days,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Courtney.
</p>
<p>Polly and Eleanor exchanged troubled glances
for it was evident that their match-making was
hopeless. But the voyage to the Orient might develop
many interesting things which were not revealed
to the actors then. Thus we leave Polly
and Eleanor for the time, and return to our own
affairs until it is time to go on board Mr. Dalken&#8217;s
yacht for the long trip half-way around the world.
